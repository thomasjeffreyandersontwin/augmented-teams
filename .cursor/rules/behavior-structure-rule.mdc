**When** creating or updating any AI behavior (rule, command, code, or MCP tool),
**then** follow the defined structure and naming conventions to ensure consistency and discoverability.

**Rule Structure:**
* Rules must start with `**When** <event> condition,` — Describe the triggering event or condition
* Follow with `**then** <action>` — Describe what should happen

**Always:**
* Name files using `<feature>-<behavior-name>-<type>.<ext>` pattern (e.g., `behavior-sync-cmd.md`, `behavior-index-cmd.py`).
* **For rules with multiple commands**, add a verb suffix: `<feature>-<behavior-name>-<verb>-cmd.md` (e.g., `behavior-structure-validate-cmd.md`, `behavior-structure-fix-cmd.md`, `behavior-structure-create-cmd.md`).
* Rules remain: `<feature>-<behavior-name>-rule.mdc` (no verb suffix).
* Keep each behavior in its own folder under `features/<feature>/cursor/`.
* Link related files by prefix (same `<feature>-<behavior-name>` prefix; commands can have additional verb suffixes).
* **Rules must reference the commands that execute them** — Include section: `**Executing Commands:** * \command-name — [what the command is] [when to call it]`
* **Commands must reference:**
  * Rules they follow: `**Rule:** * \rule-name — [description]`
  * Code they call: `**Implementation:** * function_name() — [description]`
  * When to use AI: `**AI Usage:** * [when AI should handle this]`
  * When to use code: `**Code Usage:** * [when code should handle this]`
* Document relationships (rule ↔ command ↔ code) using references in markdown headers.
* Include a short description at the top of every rule and command file.
* Validate structure before committing changes.
* Fix structure issues automatically when possible.
* Version all behavior files via Git; treat each change as a traceable commit.
* Run validation (@behavior-structure validate) before merging any new or updated behaviors.

**Never:**
* Mix unrelated behaviors in the same folder.
* Use ambiguous names like `new-rule.mdc` or `temp-cmd.md`.
* Leave files undocumented or unreferenced.
* Create rules without referencing executing commands.
* Create commands without referencing rules and code.
* Manually fix structure issues that can be automated.
