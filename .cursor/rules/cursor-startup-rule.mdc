**When** Cursor IDE workspace is opened or a new chat session begins,
**then** automatically check behavior consistency if behaviors have changed since last check,
**and** notify the user if inconsistencies are found.

**Always:**
* On workspace open, check if `.cursor/behavior-consistency-report.md` exists and its age
* If report is older than 1 day or doesn't exist, automatically run `\behavior-consistency`
* If behavior files have changed (checked via index modification times), run consistency check
* Display a summary of any found inconsistencies in the chat
* Do not block workflow if consistency check fails or OpenAI API is unavailable

**Never:**
* Run expensive consistency checks on every single message
* Block the user from working while consistency check runs
* Show consistency warnings unless actual issues are found

**Executing Commands:**
* `\behavior-consistency` — Run consistency check automatically on startup if needed
* VS Code task "Behavior Consistency Check" — Can be configured to run on folder open
