**Location**: `broney_poney_app/docs/stories/map/broney-poney-app-story-map.md`

> **CRITICAL MARKDOWN FORMATTING**: All tree structure lines MUST end with TWO SPACES (  ) for proper line breaks. Without two spaces, markdown will wrap lines together into one long line, breaking the visual tree structure.

> **CRITICAL HIERARCHY FORMATTING**: The {epic_hierarchy} section MUST use tree structure characters to show hierarchy:
> - Use `│` (vertical line) for continuing branches
> - Use `├─` (branch) for items that have siblings below them
> - Use `└─` (end branch) for the last item in a group
> - Epic format: `🎯 **Epic Name** (X features, ~Y stories)  `
> - Feature format: `├─ ⚙️ **Feature Name** (~Z stories)  ` or `└─ ⚙️ **Feature Name** (~Z stories)  ` for last feature
> - Story format (when present): `│  ├─ 📝 Story: [Verb-Noun Name]  ` followed by `│  │  *[Component interaction description]*  ` on the next line, or `│  └─ 📝 Story: [Verb-Noun Name]  ` for last story
> - **MANDATORY STORY NAMING FORMAT**: All story names MUST follow Actor-Verb-Noun format:
>   - Story name: Concise Verb-Noun format (e.g., "Create User Account", "Upload Photo to Profile", "Browse Available Photos")
>   - Description: Italicized component interaction description showing component-to-component interactions (e.g., "*User provides registration information and User Account system creates account with validation*")
