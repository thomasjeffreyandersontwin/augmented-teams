direct epric, story, acceptance criteraia read and write navigate, ROA exposed by MCP
move story io to real pythn tests

batch runs
Mural, somain oriented integrtatin first with drawio 

Asking a questin -- just answer dont do anythinhg
always trying to save legacy code


aito refresh MCP sever chach on update of code 

code stroy code to stroy bot uses cklean code (hack for now)


add fix action take in context, and inject "follow rule" when performking them

need simple runs

new base action - simple run 
story--> ac --> scenario -->  test --> code --> deploys

include rpe-exting work inproject to answer your questrions first

add cocneot of domakn sync and one knwledge graph across two 

confirm stroy scope of taks before strtting
eg explorarin cxonfoirmed tese arfe the stroies correct?

build a new bot congif and populate based on context

behavior add cuszotma citon

needto add architecture spike after shaping

scenario and examples merge and create strategy arou d embedded examples vs tables


synch and render need to be separate Tools

add the idea od ub behaviors (mayne aytinh with a 1_folder is a behavior?)

stories need an auto extractor back to json
strategies need to connect rulesyes
simp,le architecture temp,ating for code

connect test classes  to stories, tewst methosd to scenarios  and test files to epics in graph 
add a rule always plce helpers as locally as you can (test rule)

generator for test easy - creates test file, test classes and test scenario methods
will help kill nonsnense like

givne when then tets one doicstring  > given when then comment above relevant code 

kill docstrings i hate them  

inject principls eg alays simplest code, least bespoke code, dont dsuppor tlegavcy


Add manual test to flow - gove steps reqiuried to manually test te systew,


validate state is not done when starting it again for a scoped item;  increment
way to eager to remove entire tests

fix disocvered AC are marked as found during testing vs up front


help for user testing  --> copuld be generation of comand that have steps AI can do iwth some data

links ion story md to code

more deliberatelymoving workflow out of the instructions so that no workflow happens if you drag and drop something inYou have to be specific as it's confusing the actual code, that all we only include it if we're not using codes
we need the concepts of runs because a workflow only makes sense within the concept of a run EG we might be doing a workflow on a particular single story while also doing a run on a particular epicSo we need to be able to set the run and then go back to that run
all render documents should have hyperlinks to other render documentsas appropriate


standsalone synch command 



make instructions a lot for the actual bot that's running where you are getting into instruction below again which is the reason I started this in the first place is to avoid this kind of thing
 









------------------
call a behaviorCall all behaviors with one action
need something to in the background just update everything based on what has changed the latest so if the story graph was changed it just runs render automatically or if an artifact was changed it renders extract and then render
