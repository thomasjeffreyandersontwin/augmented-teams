# Story Map: {product_name}

**Navigation:** [📊 Increments](../increments/{product_name_slug}-story-map-increments.md)

**File Name**: `{product_name_slug}-story-map.md`
**Location**: `{solution_folder}/docs/stories/map/{product_name_slug}-story-map.md`

> **CRITICAL MARKDOWN FORMATTING**: All tree structure lines MUST end with TWO SPACES (  ) for proper line breaks. Without two spaces, markdown will wrap lines together into one long line, breaking the visual tree structure.

> **CRITICAL HIERARCHY FORMATTING**: The {epic_hierarchy} section MUST use tree structure characters to show hierarchy:
> - Use `│` (vertical line) for continuing branches
> - Use `├─` (branch) for items that have siblings below them
> - Use `└─` (end branch) for the last item in a group
> - Epic format: `🎯 **Epic Name** (X features, ~Y stories)  `
> - Feature format: `├─ ⚙️ **Feature Name** (~Z stories)  ` or `└─ ⚙️ **Feature Name** (~Z stories)  ` for last feature
> - Story format (when present): `│  ├─ 📝 Story: [Verb-Noun Name]  ` followed by `│  │  *[Component interaction description]*  ` on the next line, or `│  └─ 📝 Story: [Verb-Noun Name]  ` for last story
> - **MANDATORY STORY NAMING FORMAT**: All story names MUST follow Actor-Verb-Noun format:
>   - Story name: Concise Verb-Noun format (e.g., "Create Mob from Selected Tokens", "Display Mob Grouping in Combat Tracker", "Execute Mob Attack with Strategy")
>   - Description: Italicized component interaction description showing component-to-component interactions (e.g., "*GM selects multiple minion tokens on canvas and Mob manager creates mob with selected tokens and assigns random leader*")
> - Example structure:
>   ```
>   🎯 **Epic Name** (2 features, ~8 stories)  
>   │  
>   ├─ ⚙️ **Feature 1** (~5 stories)  
>   │  ├─ 📝 Story: Create Mob from Selected Tokens  
>   │  │  *GM selects multiple minion tokens on canvas and Mob manager creates mob*  
>   │  └─ 📝 Story: Display Mob Grouping  
>   │     *Combat Tracker receives mob creation notification and updates display*  
>   │  
>   └─ ⚙️ **Feature 2** (~3 stories)  
>      └─ 📝 Story: Execute Mob Attack  
>         *Combat Tracker moves to mob leader's turn and Mob manager forwards action*  
>   ```
