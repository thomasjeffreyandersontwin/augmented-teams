# Shaping Workflow End-to-End Test Instructions

**Purpose:** This file contains step-by-step instructions for an AI to execute and validate the entire shaping workflow for the mob_minion project.

**Project Location:** `demo/mob_minion/`

**Important:** This is a TEST workflow. A backup has been created. Follow these instructions exactly to validate the entire shaping process works correctly.

---

## Execution Modes

This test can be run in two modes:

### Mode 1: Straight-Through Passing (Automated)

**Purpose:** Run the entire workflow automatically and provide a comprehensive report at the end.

**Instructions for AI:**
- Execute ALL phases (0-8) sequentially without stopping
- Complete each step and move immediately to the next
- Do NOT pause for user confirmation between steps
- At the end, provide a comprehensive report with:
  - Summary of all phases completed
  - Files created and their locations
  - Any issues or errors encountered
  - Validation results for each phase
  - Final state of workflow_state.json
  - List of all files in docs/stories/ directory

**When to use:** When you want to quickly validate the entire workflow runs end-to-end.

---

### Mode 2: Pause Mode (Step-by-Step with Review)

**Purpose:** Go through each step one at a time, pausing after each step for user review.

**Instructions for AI:**
- Execute ONE step at a time
- After completing each step:
  1. **STOP and report completion**
  2. **Show what was created/changed** (file paths, key content snippets)
  3. **Wait for user confirmation** before proceeding to next step
  4. Use format: "✅ Step X.Y completed. [Summary]. Waiting for your confirmation to proceed to Step X.Y+1."
- Do NOT proceed to the next step until user explicitly confirms
- After user confirms, proceed to the next step and repeat

**Step Completion Report Format:**
```
✅ Step X.Y: [Step Name] - COMPLETED

**What was done:**
- [Action taken]

**Files created/modified:**
- [File path 1] - [Brief description]
- [File path 2] - [Brief description]

**Validation results:**
- ✅ [Validation check 1]
- ✅ [Validation check 2]

**Ready for next step:** Step X.Y+1: [Next Step Name]

[WAITING FOR USER CONFIRMATION TO PROCEED]
```

**When to use:** When you want to review each step individually and see the state at each point.

---

## Mode Selection

**At the start of execution, AI must:**
1. Determine which mode to use based on user instruction:
   - User says "straight-through", "automated", "run all", "no pauses" → Use **Straight-Through Mode**
   - User says "pause mode", "step by step", "one at a time", "pause after each" → Use **Pause Mode**
   - No mode specified → Use **Pause Mode** (default for safety)
2. Announce the selected mode clearly:
   - **Straight-Through:** "Running in STRAIGHT-THROUGH mode - will complete all phases automatically and provide final report at the end"
   - **Pause Mode:** "Running in PAUSE mode - will pause after each step for your review and confirmation"

**Default:** If mode not specified, use **Pause Mode** for safety.

---

## Phase 0: Cleanup and Preparation

### Step 6.1: Review Validate Rules Instructions

**Action:** Review the instructions returned from validate_rules action

**Expected Content:**
- Instructions should be PRIMARY (actionable steps), not just rules
- Instructions should tell AI to:
  1. Load clarification.json and planning.json
  2. Check content against rules
  3. Generate validation report
  4. **Save report to file at report_path**
- `content_to_validate` should include `report_path` pointing to `validation-report.md`

**Validation:**
- Instructions structure should have:
  - `base_instructions` (primary - list of instruction strings)
  - `validation_rules` (supporting context - list of rules)
  - `content_to_validate.report_path` (path where to save report)
- Instructions should NOT just be raw rules - they should be actionable

### Step 6.2: Execute Validation

**Action:** As the AI, follow the instructions to:
1. Load clarification.json and planning.json
2. Load story-graph.json and rendered outputs
3. Check content against all validation rules
4. Identify violations (naming format, typos, etc.)
5. Generate validation report with:
   - Status (completed with violations / all passed)
   - List of violations found
   - Specific examples from content
   - Suggested corrections
   - Requirements verification
6. **SAVE the report to the file specified in report_path**

**Validation:**

**Validation:**
- `workflow_state.json` should show: `current_action: "story_bot.shape.validate_rules"`
- `completed_actions` should include all actions: initialize_project, gather_context, decide_planning_criteria, build_knowledge, render_output, validate_rules
- No next action should be available (terminal action)

---

### Step 6.3: Verify Workflow Completion

**Action:** Check that validate_rules is the terminal action

**Validation:**
- `workflow_state.json` should show: `current_action: "story_bot.shape.validate_rules"`
- `completed_actions` should include all actions: initialize_project, gather_context, decide_planning_criteria, build_knowledge, render_output, validate_rules
- No next action should be available (terminal action)

**PAUSE MODE:** After validation, report completion and wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 7.1

---

## Phase 7: Final Validation

**Action:** Check that all expected files exist:

**Required Files:**
- `demo/mob_minion/docs/stories/clarification.json`

- `agile_bot/bots/story_bot/current_project.json`

**Validation:**
- All files should exist
- All files should have content (not empty)
- Files should be properly formatted (JSON should be valid, Markdown should be readable)

### Step 7.2: Verify Workflow State

**Action:** Check workflow_state.json

**Validation:**
- `current_behavior` should be `"story_bot.shape"`
- `current_action` should be `"story_bot.shape.validate_rules"`
- `completed_actions` should contain all 6 actions in order
- Each completed action should have a timestamp

### Step 7.3: Verify Content Quality

**Action:** Spot-check content quality:

**Story-Graph Validation:**
- Should have at least one epic (e.g., "Manage Mobs")
- Epics should have domain_concepts
- Stories should use verb-noun format
- Sequential order should be present

**Domain Model Validation:**
- Domain concepts should match clarification.json
- Descriptions should use ubiquitous language
- NO OSAP examples should appear

**Validation Report Validation:**
- Should list violations found (if any)
- Should reference clarification.json and planning.json
- Should provide specific corrections

---

## Phase 8: Test Edge Cases

### Step 8.1: Test Workflow Resume After Interruption

**Action:** 
1. Note the current workflow state
2. Simulate an interruption (don't actually interrupt, just verify the state would allow resume)
3. Verify that running `/story_bot-shape` again would resume at the correct action

**Validation:**
- Workflow state should be sufficient to resume
- Current action should be clear from workflow_state.json

### Step 8.2: Test Activity Logging

**Action:** Check activity_log.json (if it exists)

**Validation:**
- Should have entries for each action executed
- Entries should have action_state, timestamp, status
- Completion entries should have outputs

---

---

## Notes for AI Executing This Test

- **Follow instructions sequentially** - each phase builds on the previous
- **Validate after each step** - don't proceed if validation fails
- **Simulate human-in-the-loop** - when instructions say "present to user" or "ask user", simulate providing reasonable answers based on input.txt
- **Check file contents** - don't just check files exist, verify they have correct content
- **Report issues** - if any step fails, document what failed and why
- **Use commands exactly as specified** - `/story_bot-shape`, `/story_bot-continue`, etc.

### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Straight-Through Mode:**
- Execute all steps without pausing
- Collect validation results as you go
- At the end, provide comprehensive report covering all phases
- Report should include: summary, files created, validation results, any issues, final state

**Pause Mode:**
- After EACH step marked with "PAUSE MODE", you MUST:
  1. Report step completion with the format shown above
  2. Show what was created/changed
  3. Show validation results
  4. Explicitly state you are waiting for user confirmation
  5. DO NOT proceed until user explicitly confirms (e.g., "proceed", "continue", "next", "yes")
- User may ask questions or request changes between steps - handle those before proceeding
