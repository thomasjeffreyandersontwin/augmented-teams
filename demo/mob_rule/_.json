    "user_types": "Game Masters (GMs) and Players",
    "user_goals": "GMs want to easily configure descriptor-based animations that automatically play. Players want visual feedback when powers are activated. Both want support for infinite power combinations through reusable components.",
    "primary_users": "Game Masters and Players using Foundry VTT for MM3E games",
    "first_action": "Using an animation configured out of the box (automatically associated with a descriptor)",
    "problems_solved": "The need to create animations from scratch for every single possible power. Currently takes a long time to develop a new animation associated with a power. In an effects-based system, you can have infinite number of power combinations, so manually creating animations for each is impossible.",
    "struggles": "Players currently get stuck in that it takes a long time to develop a new animation associated with a power. The current system requires a lot of manual work to assemble sequencer components.",
    "integrations": "Foundry VTT core, foundry-mm3 system (new Mutants and Masterminds system), Sequencer module (for animations), Token Magic FX (small reliance), JB2A and other animation content providers. NOTE: Automated Animations (autorec) integration is NOT needed - we will not be doing anything that works with automated animations.",
    "stakeholder_groups": "Foundry VTT MM3E community, module developers",
    "first_user_action": "Install the module, configure descriptor animations (either use defaults or customize via visual editor), then use a power item in-game which automatically triggers the appropriate animation",
    "problems_eliminated": "Manual animation setup for every power combination, lack of reusable animation components, boilerplate repetition in animation definitions, poor integration with new foundry-mm3 system",
    "user_struggles": "Currently having to manually create animations for each power descriptor/range/area/effect combination, repeating similar code patterns, lack of visual editor for rapid animation composition",
    "system_integrations": "Foundry VTT core system, Sequencer module (required), JB2A Patreon assets, Jacks Cartoon Spell Effects, Jinkers Animation, FXMaster, Token Magic FX, new foundry-mm3 system (https://github.com/Ethaks/foundry-mm3)",
    "integration_behaviors": "Module hooks into Foundry VTT power roll events (rollPower, attackRolled), looks up animations based on power item attributes (descriptor, range, area, effect), executes Sequencer animations, integrates with foundry-mm3 attack system which has better built-in attack functionality",
    "distinct_user_types": "Game Masters (GMs) who configure animations and Players who trigger animations during gameplay",
    "primary_stakeholders": "Foundry VTT MM3E community, module developers, GMs and Players using the foundry-mm3 system"
