I want to start a new project around handling minions within a role playing game virtual tabletop system most of the functionality is already there so this is just a small piece of functionality that's going to allow me to turn minions into mobs a mod would be defined as a collection of minions that can act together so I don't have to click on every token of every minion to get them to do something I just click on any one of the minions and they'll all perform the same actions Another big idea with this is once I've grouped minions into mobs I can select a strategy and the strategy could be attack the most powerful target Attack the weakest target I think I have some other strategies in the green there like defend the leader you know attack the most damaged person so all the strategies are those green stickiness you see and then underneath that you've got like a really high level you could almost call it a story map but it's got some things like editing mobs so how do I create a mob how do I group people to mobs Spawn mobs from a couple actors could I have mock templates choose targets different ways of choosing a target different ways of attacking this is a game system that has range merely the person would have to move to the other person area attack the fleeing part I don't really care about key to this system is that it's going to work within the Foundry virtual tabletop system so you have to be writing any initial shaping we do with stories around using their system and stuff
