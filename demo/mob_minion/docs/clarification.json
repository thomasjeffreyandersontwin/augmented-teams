    "key_questions": {
      "user_types": {
        "question": "Who are the distinct types of users (e.g., operational users, power users, compliance consumers, content creators, producers)?",
        "answer": "Game Masters (GMs) / Dungeon Masters (DMs) using Foundry VTT. They control multiple minion tokens and need efficient group management."
      },
      "user_goals": {
        "question": "What are the key goals, behaviors, or decisions each group is trying to accomplish using this capability?",
        "answer": "Goal: Control multiple minions as a single 'mob' unit instead of individually. Behavior: Click one minion token to make all minions in the mob perform the same action. Decision: Select strategies for mob behavior (attack most powerful, attack weakest, defend leader, attack most damaged)."
      },
      "primary_users": {
        "question": "Who are the primary users or stakeholder groups impacted?",
        "answer": "Game Masters running combat encounters in Foundry VTT who manage multiple minion tokens."
      },
      "first_action": {
        "question": "What is the first thing users will try to do with this new capability or system?",
        "answer": "Group existing minion tokens into a mob, then select a strategy and execute actions for the entire mob."
      },
      "problems_solved": {
        "question": "What problems, inefficiencies, or workarounds is this request trying to eliminate?",
        "answer": "Eliminates the need to click on every individual minion token to perform actions. Currently, GMs must click each minion separately, which is time-consuming during combat."
      },
      "struggle_points": {
        "question": "Where are users currently struggling, getting stuck, or experiencing delays in the process we're aiming to improve?",
        "answer": "During combat encounters when managing multiple minions, requiring repetitive clicking on each token individually."
      },
      "system_integrations": {
        "question": "What other systems, data sources, or tools does this capability need to interact with in order to deliver value?",
        "answer": "Foundry VTT system - specifically: Actor system (for minion tokens), Token system (for visual representation), Combat system (for turn management), Range/movement mechanics, Attack/action systems, Template system (for mob templates)."
      },
      "integration_behaviors": {
        "question": "What are the key behaviors or integration points that define how these systems support or depend on one another?",
        "answer": "Mobs depend on Foundry's Actor/Token system for minion representation. Strategy system determines target selection and action execution. Range/movement mechanics determine if minions need to move before attacking. Combat system coordinates mob actions within turn structure."
      },
      "business_domain": {
        "question": "What is the business domain we are modeling?",
        "answer": "Virtual tabletop game management - specifically minion/mob combat management within Foundry VTT."
      },
      "core_concepts": {
        "question": "What are the core business concepts and their relationships?",
        "answer": "Minion: Individual game entity/token. Mob: Collection of minions that act together. Strategy: Behavioral rules for mob actions (target selection, attack patterns). Actions: Combat actions (attack, move, area attack, etc.). Target Selection: Methods for choosing targets (most powerful, weakest, most damaged, fleeing, etc.). Relationships: Mobs contain multiple Minions. Mobs have a Strategy. Strategies determine Target Selection and Actions."
      },
      "sub_domains": {
        "question": "What are the distinct sub-domains or business capabilities?",
        "answer": "1. Mob Management (create, edit, group minions), 2. Strategy Selection (choose and apply strategies), 3. Target Selection (identify targets based on strategy), 4. Action Execution (perform attacks, movement, area attacks), 5. Integration with Foundry VTT (actor/token/combat systems)."
      },
      "domain_boundaries": {
        "question": "What are the boundaries between different parts of the domain?",
        "answer": "Mob Management is separate from Foundry's core systems but integrates with them. Strategy logic is independent but uses Foundry's combat/targeting data. Action execution bridges mob commands and Foundry's action system."
      },
      "domain_events": {
        "question": "What domain events occur in this business domain?",
        "answer": "Mob created, Minions grouped into mob, Strategy selected, Target chosen (based on strategy), Mob action executed, Mob spawned from template, Mob edited/modified."
      },
      "business_rules": {
        "question": "What are the key business rules and constraints?",
        "answer": "Mobs are collections of minions that act together. One click on any mob member triggers actions for all members. Strategies determine target selection and behavior. Range mechanics may require movement before attacking. Must work within Foundry VTT's existing systems. Area attacks affect multiple targets. Different attack methods available (melee, ranged, area)."
      },
      "domain_language": {
        "question": "What domain language do business experts use to describe this domain?",
        "answer": "Mob (collection of minions), Minion (individual token/actor), Strategy (behavioral rules), Target selection (choosing who to attack), Spawn (create from template), Group (associate minions with mob), Area attack (attack affecting multiple targets), Range (distance mechanics), Token (visual representation in Foundry)."
      }
