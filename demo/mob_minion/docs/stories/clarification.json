    "key_questions": {
      "Who are the distinct types of users?": "Primary: Game Masters running sessions in Foundry VTT who need to control many minion tokens efficiently. Secondary: Players are impacted by smoother turn flow but are not direct operators.",
      "What are the key goals, behaviors, or decisions each group is trying to accomplish using this capability?": "GM wants to group minions into mobs and issue one command so all minions act together; choose and apply strategies such as attack most powerful/weakest, defend leader, attack most damaged; avoid per-token clicking.",
      "Who are the primary users or stakeholder groups impacted?": "Game Masters are the primary users; players experience the outcomes (faster, consistent combat turns).",
      "What is the first thing users will try to do with this new capability or system?": "Select several minion tokens in Foundry VTT, create a mob from them, and apply a strategy so they act together on a target.",
      "What problems, inefficiencies, or workarounds is this request trying to eliminate?": "Eliminates clicking every individual minion to perform the same action and the resulting slow, inconsistent execution.",
      "Where are users currently struggling, getting stuck, or experiencing delays in the process we're aiming to improve?": "Managing many minions during combat—selecting targets, issuing repeated actions, and keeping actions synchronized across minions.",
      "What other systems, data sources, or tools does this capability need to interact with in order to deliver value?": "Needs to integrate with Foundry Virtual Tabletop (tokens/actors, targeting, movement/attack actions). No other external systems mentioned.",
      "What are the key behaviors or integration points that define how these systems support or depend on one another?": "Create mobs from existing minion tokens/actors; hook into Foundry actions for selecting targets, executing attacks/moves; apply chosen strategy so all mob members follow it.",
      "What is the business domain we are modeling?": "Virtual tabletop combat management within Foundry VTT, focused on minion grouping and coordinated actions.",
      "What are the core business concepts and their relationships?": "Minion (individual token), Mob (collection of minions acting together), Strategy (rules for choosing targets/behavior), Target (actor chosen by strategy), Action (attack/defend/move) executed by mob members.",
      "What are the distinct sub-domains or business capabilities?": "Grouping/minion-to-mob management; strategy selection/configuration; target selection; coordinated action execution; possibly mob template/spawn management.",
      "What are the boundaries between different parts of the domain?": "Mob management (grouping, membership) is separate from strategy logic (how to pick targets/behaviors) and from Foundry core mechanics (movement/attack resolution). Limited detail on technical boundaries in the source.",
      "What domain events occur in this business domain?": "Mob created, minions added/removed, strategy selected/changed, target chosen, mob action executed, mob disbanded.",
      "What are the key business rules and constraints?": "Mobs act together under a selected strategy (e.g., attack most powerful/weakest, defend leader, attack most damaged); actions must operate within Foundry VTT mechanics. Additional rules (range, movement, templates) are not specified.",
      "What domain language do business experts use to describe this domain?": "Terms: minion, mob, group, strategy (attack most powerful/weakest, defend leader, attack most damaged), spawn, template, choose targets, area attack, Foundry Virtual Tabletop."
