      "key_goals_behaviors_decisions": "Goal: Efficiently control multiple minions as coordinated groups (mobs) instead of individually. Behavior: Click one minion token to command the entire mob. Decision: Select strategies for mob behavior (attack strongest/weakest, defend leader, attack most damaged, etc.)",
      "primary_users_stakeholders": "Game Masters using Foundry VTT to run RPG sessions with minions",
      "first_action": "Group individual minion tokens into a mob so they can be controlled together",
      "problems_inefficiencies_workarounds": "Eliminates the need to click each minion token individually to perform actions. Currently, GMs must select and command each minion separately, which is time-consuming during combat",

      "other_systems_data_sources_tools": "Foundry VTT system - specifically: Actor/token system (to group minions), Combat system (for actions), Movement/range system (for positioning and area attacks), Template system (for spawning mobs from templates)",
      "key_behaviors_integration_points": "Mobs depend on Foundry's actor system to identify and group minions. Mobs use Foundry's combat system to execute actions. Strategies depend on combat state (health, positioning, target selection). Movement/range system determines valid actions and targets. Templates enable spawning mobs from predefined actor configurations",

Strategy: Behavioral rules for mob actions (attack strongest, attack weakest, defend leader, attack most damaged). Target Selection: Method for choosing which enemy to attack. Action: What the mob does (move, attack, area attack, etc.). Range: Distance constraints for actions. Template: Predefined configuration for spawning mobs",

      "key_business_rules_constraints": "Mobs are collections of minions that act together. Selecting one minion in a mob controls all minions in that mob.
