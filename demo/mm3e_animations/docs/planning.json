      "focus_areas": "Drill down on integration between components: animation builder, animation components, sequencer, MM3e attack system, targeting, and chat attack systems. Focus on getting the domain model right and ensuring it is flexible enough to support easily adding new components and new animation components. Show full domain model even if simplified - less about architectural complexity, more about domain correctness and flexibility.",
      "scope_level": "End-to-end user-system behavior with deeper granularity on internal components. Show how components interact: building an animation with base templates, launching based on descriptor association, handling conditions (hit/miss/defend) even if not all implemented in initial scope. Need to show the domain model can support these conditions even if scope is bigger than initial implementation.",
      "key_integration_points": "1) Building animation with base templates, 2) Launching animation based on descriptor association, 3) Triggering on attack hit/miss conditions, 4) Integration between animation builder, animation components, sequencer, MM3e attack system, targeting, and chat attack systems",
      "story_drill_down": "Dig deep on system interactions - Focus on component-level interactions between User, AI Chat, Story Agent MCP Server, and Base Agent. Show internal details: loading clarification questions from JSON, AI answering questions, user providing feedback, MCP saving answers, activity tracking, template rendering with specific templates, etc. Drill down on all functionality to date as it is built, showing the complete flow at component level.",
      "flow_scope": "Journey level with component detail - Complete user journey from adding documents to chat through getting generated story maps, but with detailed component-level interactions showing: JSON loading, MCP tool calls, Base Agent method invocations, template rendering, file saving, activity tracking, etc."
    },
    "assumptions_made": {
      "domain_focus": "Focus on domain model correctness and flexibility over architectural complexity. Domain model must be flexible enough to easily add new components and new animation components.",
      "component_granularity": "Show deeper granularity on internal components: animation builder, animation components, sequencer, MM3e attack system, targeting, chat attack systems. Understand how these components interact.",
      "scope_vs_model": "Scope will be bigger than initial implementation (e.g., not all conditions like hit/miss/defend will be handled initially), but domain model must show full capability to support these conditions for future extensibility.",
      "integration_priority": "Priority is understanding integration patterns between our components, the Mutants and Mastermind system, and core Foundry systems.",
      "focus_scope": "Focus on component-level interactions showing internal details of how User, AI Chat, Story Agent MCP Server, and Base Agent components interact. Show JSON loading, MCP tool calls, method invocations, template rendering, file operations, activity tracking.",
      "drill_down_approach": "Drill down on all functionality to date as it is built - show complete flow at component level rather than drilling deep on one piece. This makes sense because the system is already built and we need to document the full component interactions.",
      "documentation_approach": "Document the Story Agent user experience but show Base Agent component interactions when they are invoked. Reference specific files (agent.json, agent.py, agent_test.py, story_agent.py, story_agent_test.py) to show implementation details.",
      "template_details": "Show which templates are used for rendering (story-map-decomposition-template.md, story-map-increments-template.md, etc.) and how they are applied to structured JSON content."
