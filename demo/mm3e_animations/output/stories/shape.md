## Story Map Structure

🎯 **Start Story Development Session** (8 features, ~34 stories)  

│  
├─ ⚙️ **Initialize Story Agent Workflow** (~3 stories)  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: User Adds Context to Chat  
│  │  *User adds documents, models, text descriptions, diagrams to Cursor/VS Code chat window and requests to start shaping/planning/building a new project*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: AI Chat Invokes Story Agent MCP  
│  │  *AI Chat detects story shaping request and calls Story Agent MCP Server via agent_get_state or agent_get_instructions tool*  
│  └─ 📝 Story: MCP Server Initializes Agent  
│     *Story Agent MCP Server (agent_mcp_server.py) calls AgentStateManager.get_agent() which creates Agent instance with agent_name="stories", loads agent.json from agents/stories/agent.json, creates Project with activity_area="stories", initializes Workflow with behaviors dictionary from agent.json*  
│  
├─ ⚙️ **Load Configuration from JSON** (~4 stories)  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Load Base Agent Config  
│  │  *Agent._load_base_agent_config() loads agents/base/agent.json and retrieves prompt_templates and trigger_words into Agent._prompt_templates and Agent._base_trigger_words*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Load Story Agent Config  
│  │  *Agent._load_agent_config() loads agents/stories/agent.json, creates Rules from rules config, initializes behaviors dictionary by creating Behavior objects for each behavior (shape, prioritization, discovery, exploration, specification) with order, guardrails, rules, actions, content configs*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Initialize Workflow from Behaviors  
│  │  *Agent._initialize_components() creates Workflow instance, sets workflow._behaviors to behaviors dictionary, calls workflow._derive_stages_from_behaviors() which sorts behaviors by order property and returns stage names list, sets workflow.stages to derived stages*  
│  └─ 📝 Story: Start Workflow at Shape Behavior  
│     *Agent._start_workflow_if_needed() calls workflow.start_next_stage() to get first behavior (shape: order=1), then workflow.start(shape) which calls behavior.initialize_for_workflow() to reset actions and return first action (clarification), sets workflow._current_stage="shape" and workflow._current_action to clarification action*  
│  
├─ ⚙️ **Clarify Context Requirements** (~6 stories)  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Load Clarification Questions from JSON  
│  │  *When AI Chat calls agent_get_instructions(), MCP Server calls agent.instructions property which delegates to workflow.current_action.instructions. Clarification action generates instructions by calling behavior.guardrails.requirements_clarification_instructions which loads key_questions and evidence lists from agents/stories/agent.json behaviors.shape.guardrails.required_context*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: AI Attempts to Answer Questions  
│  │  *AI Chat receives instructions with key_questions array and evidence array, AI analyzes provided context (documents, models, text) and attempts to answer each question based on available information*

│  ├─ 📝 Story: User Provides Feedback  
│  │  *User reviews presented questions/answers, provides corrections or additional detail for incomplete answers, confirms answers are complete*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: MCP Saves Clarification Answers  
│  │  *AI Chat calls agent_store_clarification(key_questions_answered, evidence_provided, additional_questions_answered). MCP Server calls agent.store() which delegates to current action (clarification).store() which calls Project.store_clarification() to update Project.clarification dict and save to project_area/docs/clarification.json*  
│  └─ 📝 Story: Track Clarification Activity  
│     *Project.store_clarification() calls Project.track_activity("store_clarification", behavior_name, data) which creates activity entry and appends to activity_log, saves activity_log to project_area/docs/activity/activity.json*  
│  
├─ ⚙️ **Plan Story Development Approach** (~5 stories)  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Load Planning Assumptions from JSON  
│  │  *When moving to planning action, behavior.guardrails.get_planning_instructions() loads typical_assumptions and decision_making_criteria from agents/stories/agent.json behaviors.shape.guardrails.planning, formats instructions with BaseInstructions.planning_intro*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Present Assumptions and Decision Criteria

│  └─ 📝 Story: Track Planning Activity  
│     *Project.store_planning() calls Project.track_activity("store_planning", behavior_name, data) which creates activity entry and appends to activity_log, saves to project_area/docs/activity/activity.json*  
│  
├─ ⚙️ **Build Structured Story Map Content** (~4 stories)  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Load Story Graph Schema  
│  │  *When moving to build_structure action, Content.build_instructions includes instructions to load story_graph.json schema from agents/stories/story_graph.json to understand required structure (solution, epics, features, stories, increments)*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Generate Structured JSON Content  
│  │  *AI Chat follows build_instructions which include agent-level rules, behavior-level rules, and structured_content instructions from agents/stories/agent.json. AI generates structured JSON following story_graph.json schema with solution, epics array, features array, stories array, increments array*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: MCP Saves Structured Content  
│  │  *AI Chat calls agent_store_structured(structured). MCP Server calls agent.store(structured=structured) which sets current_behavior.content.structured, triggering Content.structured setter which calls Content.store().

│  ├─ 📝 Story: MCP Saves Rendered Markdown  
│  │  *AI Chat calls agent_store_rendered(rendered). MCP Server calls agent.store(rendered=rendered) which sets current_behavior.content.rendered["story_map"], triggering Content.rendered setter which calls Content.store(). Content.store() calls Project.store_output(rendered={"story_map": {"output": rendered, "template": "templates/story-map-decomposition-template.md"}}) which saves markdown to project_area/docs/stories/map/{product_name}-story-map.md via Project._save_rendered()*  
│  ├─ 📝 Story: Track Rendering Activity  
│  │  *Project.store_output() calls Project.track_activity("store_rendered", behavior_name, {"output": "story_map"}) which creates activity entry and appends to activity_log, saves to project_area/docs/activity/activity.json*
