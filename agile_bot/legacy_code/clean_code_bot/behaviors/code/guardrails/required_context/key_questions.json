    "What programming language specialization should be used? (python, javascript, or both)",

    "What are the major domain objects, entities, or data structures involved?",
    "What programming paradigm should be used: functional programming, object-oriented programming, or a hybrid approach?",
    "How should the code be organized into layers or modules? (e.g., domain layer, service layer, presentation layer, data access layer)",
    "What are the key responsibilities and behaviors of each major component?",
    "What dependencies exist between components, modules, or external systems?",
    "Are there any existing code patterns, architectural styles, or design patterns to follow?",
    "What inputs are available from previous phases? (Check for: story documents, domain maps, BDD test files, existing code structure)",
    "What are the integration points with existing code or external systems?",
    "What error handling and validation requirements exist?",
    "What are the performance, scalability, or resource constraints?",
    "Are there any language-specific idioms, patterns, or conventions that must be respected?"
