    "1. Present each required question to the user clearly and explicitly in the chat window",
    "2. Wait for the user to answer each question",
    "3. **MANDATORY PRESENTATION STEP - NEVER SKIP:** After receiving answers, you MUST present in the chat window:",
    "   - **Questions Asked:** List each question you asked the user",
    "   - **Answers Provided:** Show the exact answers the user provided for each question",
    "   - **Gap Analysis:** A focused analysis highlighting where questions were NOT properly answered or need more detail",
    "   - **Request for Corrections:** Explicitly ask the user to review and provide corrections or additional detail",
    "4. Be PESSIMISTIC and CONSERVATIVE - if an answer seems incomplete, vague, or could be interpreted multiple ways, you MUST ask for clarification",
    "5. There is NEVER too much detail at this stage - it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to stop and get complete answers",
    "6. **MANDATORY STORAGE STEP:** After user confirms all answers are complete, you MUST call `agent_store_clarification()` MCP tool with:",

    "   - You have presented questions and answers in the chat window",
    "   - The user has reviewed and confirmed or corrected the answers",
    "   - ALL questions have complete, unambiguous answers confirmed by the user",
    "   - You have successfully stored the clarification data using `agent_store_clarification()`",

    "**CRITICAL REMINDER:** The presentation of questions and answers in the chat window is MANDATORY and CANNOT BE SKIPPED. This allows the user to see what was asked, how it was answered, and provide corrections. For analyze behavior specifically, incomplete clarification will lead to poor code design. Stop and get complete answers.",
    "",
    "**CONTEXT AWARENESS:** If code already exists at the target location, analyze it to infer answers where possible. If no code exists, ask all questions to understand requirements for generating clean code."
