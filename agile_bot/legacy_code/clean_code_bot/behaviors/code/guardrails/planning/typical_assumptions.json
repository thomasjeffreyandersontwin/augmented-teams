  "assumptions": [
    "Focus on maintainability and readability over performance optimizations",
    "Single Responsibility Principle - Each function/class does one thing well",
    "Dependency Injection - Dependencies passed through constructors, not created internally",
    "Immutability preferred - Minimize mutable state where possible",
    "Explicit over implicit - Make dependencies and behavior explicit",
    "Testability - Code should be easy to test in isolation",
    "Respect language-specific idioms and patterns",
    "Consider code context when generating or validating",
    "Provide actionable suggestions for violations or improvements",
    "Balance between strict adherence and practical constraints",
    "When generating code, incorporate requirements from stories, domain maps, and BDD tests",
    "When validating code, infer structure and intent from existing code",
    "Properties vs methods decision determines how object state and behavior are exposed",
    "Programming paradigm decision (functional/OOP/hybrid) guides overall code structure and patterns"
