        "One story = One command - Each story becomes a single command that triggers events and reactions",
        "Story as user journey - Decompose story into multiple commands representing user interactions, with events and reactions for each step",
        "Story as business process - Break story into commands (triggers), events (state changes), and reactions (responses) following business process flow",
        "Story as aggregate operation - Each story maps to an aggregate operation (command), producing events that trigger reactions in other aggregates",
        "Story as bounded context interaction - Stories span multiple bounded contexts, decompose into commands/events/reactions crossing context boundaries",
        "Granular decomposition - Break each story into fine-grained commands, events, and reactions for detailed event storming",
        "Coarse-grained decomposition - Keep stories at high level, identify only major commands, events, and reactions"
