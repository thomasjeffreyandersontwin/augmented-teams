  "description": "Typical assumptions for event storming behavior",
  "assumptions": [
    "Event storming extends the story map by adding commands, reactions, and events to create a more detailed flow",
    "Primary input is a story map (increment, epic, feature, collection, or full map) from the story agent",
    "If no story map is available, we can logically order a sequence of commands, reactions, and events",
    "Commands often represent user interactions and are always described in imperative",
    "Reactions are things that need to happen in Reaction to an event, always described in imperative",
    "Events are something that notifies others of a state change, always described in past-tense",
    "The event storming map shows one or more stories will relate to a sequence of commands and/or reactions, and events",
    "Event storming is a separate artifact (does not modify) the original story map",
    "Newly discovered commands, events, and reactions are added to the domain model",
    "Event storming helps identify domain boundaries and refine bounded context scope"
