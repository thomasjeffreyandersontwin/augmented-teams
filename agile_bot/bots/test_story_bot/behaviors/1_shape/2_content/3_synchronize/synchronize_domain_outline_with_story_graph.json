    "   - Removed domain concepts (in story graph but not in domain outline)",
    "   - Domain concept placement (local vs global) based on relevance to epics/sub_epics",
    "5. AI generates a report showing all differences",
    "6. AI proposes specific changes to domain_concepts arrays in story-graph.json",
    "7. User reviews and approves changes",
    "8. AI updates story-graph.json domain_concepts arrays preserving placement logic",
