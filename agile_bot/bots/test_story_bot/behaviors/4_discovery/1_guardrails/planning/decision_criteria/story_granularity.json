  "description": "Story granularity",
  "question": "What level of granularity do you want to define stories at for this increment?",
  "outcome": "Determines how detailed stories should be before moving to exploration",
  "options": [
    "User/system level interactions — gives clarity for design, testing, and responsibility",
    "Coarse-grained business process — for solutions that require a lot of business process change",
    "System inner behavior and inner workings — needed when elaboration of new complex architecture across unknown libraries and components is useful to elaborate",
    "Fine-grained bespoke work — detailed fine-grained units of work when there's a lot of custom/bespoke development required",
    "Higher-level out-of-the-box — higher level view when working with out-of-the-box solutions, configurations, or pre-existing capabilities"
