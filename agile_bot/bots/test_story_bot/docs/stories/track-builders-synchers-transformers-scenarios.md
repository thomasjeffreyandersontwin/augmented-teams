# 📝 Track Builders Synchers Transformers in Story Graph

**Navigation:** [📋 Story Map](story-map-outline.drawio) | [⚙️ Feature Overview](../README.md)

**Epic:** Render Diagram  
**Feature:** Render Story IO Diagram

## Story Description

Story IO Diagram tracks builders, synchers, and transformers in the story graph so that the system can reference and execute these components during rendering and synchronization operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Behavioral Acceptance Criteria

- **When** story graph is loaded with component references, **then** Story Graph stores builder paths and metadata
- **When** builder is referenced in story graph, **then** Story Graph includes builder path relative to behavior folder
- **When** synchronizer is referenced in story graph, **then** Story Graph includes synchronizer path relative to behavior folder
- **When** transformer is referenced in story graph, **then** Story Graph includes transformer path relative to behavior folder
- **When** story graph is saved, **then** component references are persisted in JSON structure
- **When** story graph is rendered, **then** component references are available for builder execution
- **When** invalid component path is referenced, **then** Story Graph validation detects missing component
- **When** component metadata is updated, **then** Story Graph updates component information
- **When** multiple components are referenced, **then** Story Graph maintains separate entries for each component

## Background

**Common setup steps shared across all scenarios:**

```gherkin
Given Story IO Diagram is initialized with story_graph_path
And story graph JSON file exists at story_graph_path
And behavior folder structure exists with components
```

## Scenarios

### Scenario: Story graph stores builder reference

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given story graph JSON contains builder reference at path "2_content/2_render/templates/builder.py"
And builder file exists at behavior folder relative path
When Story Graph loads from JSON file
Then Story Graph stores builder path in component registry
And Story Graph stores builder type as "builder"
And Story Graph includes builder metadata if specified
```

### Scenario: Story graph stores synchronizer reference

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given story graph JSON contains synchronizer reference at path "2_content/3_synchronize/synchronize_drawio.json"
And synchronizer configuration file exists at behavior folder relative path
When Story Graph loads from JSON file
Then Story Graph stores synchronizer path in component registry
And Story Graph stores synchronizer type as "synchronizer"
And Story Graph includes synchronizer configuration metadata
```

### Scenario: Story graph stores transformer reference

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given story graph JSON contains transformer reference at path "2_content/2_render/templates/transformer.py"
And transformer file exists at behavior folder relative path
When Story Graph loads from JSON file
Then Story Graph stores transformer path in component registry
And Story Graph stores transformer type as "transformer"
And Story Graph includes transformer metadata if specified
```

### Scenario: Story graph persists component references on save

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given Story Graph has loaded builder reference
And Story Graph has loaded synchronizer reference
And Story Graph has loaded transformer reference
When Story Graph saves to JSON file
Then JSON file contains component references array
And JSON file preserves builder path and metadata
And JSON file preserves synchronizer path and metadata
And JSON file preserves transformer path and metadata
```

### Scenario: Story graph makes component references available for rendering

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given Story Graph has loaded builder reference
And Story Graph has loaded synchronizer reference
When render output action executes
Then render output action can access builder path from Story Graph
And render output action can access synchronizer path from Story Graph
And render output action can execute builder using stored path
And render output action can execute synchronizer using stored path
```

### Scenario: Story graph validates component path exists

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given story graph JSON contains builder reference at invalid path "nonexistent/builder.py"
And builder file does not exist at specified path
When Story Graph loads from JSON file
Then Story Graph validation detects missing component
And Story Graph reports error for invalid component reference
And Story Graph marks component reference as invalid
```

### Scenario: Story graph updates component metadata

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given Story Graph has loaded builder reference with initial metadata
And builder metadata needs to be updated
When Story Graph updates component metadata
Then Story Graph updates builder information in registry
And Story Graph preserves other component references unchanged
And Story Graph persists updated metadata on save
```

### Scenario: Story graph maintains multiple component references

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given story graph JSON contains multiple builder references
And story graph JSON contains multiple synchronizer references
And story graph JSON contains multiple transformer references
When Story Graph loads from JSON file
Then Story Graph maintains separate entries for each builder
And Story Graph maintains separate entries for each synchronizer
And Story Graph maintains separate entries for each transformer
And Story Graph allows querying components by type
```

### Scenario: Story graph queries components by type

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given Story Graph has loaded multiple builder references
And Story Graph has loaded multiple synchronizer references
When Story Graph queries components by type "builder"
Then Story Graph returns all builder references
And Story Graph does not return synchronizer references
And Story Graph does not return transformer references
```

### Scenario: Story graph handles component reference with configuration

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given story graph JSON contains builder reference with configuration object
And builder configuration includes template path and output path
When Story Graph loads from JSON file
Then Story Graph stores builder path in component registry
And Story Graph stores builder configuration object
And Story Graph makes configuration available for builder execution
And Story Graph preserves configuration on save
```
