    "What is the scope of the event storming? (An increment, epic, feature, collection of stories, or entire story map?)",
    "What story map or story collection should be used as the primary input? (Load from docs/stories/map/ or docs/stories/increments/)",
    "If no story map is available, what logical sequence of commands, reactions, events can be inferred from the domain model?",
    "What are the key business events that occur in this domain flow?",
    "What commands trigger these events? (Commands often represent user or external domain interactions)",
    "What reactions occur after events? (Reactions are things that need to happen in response to an event, always described in imperative)",
    "What aggregates or bounded contexts are involved in processing commands and producing events?"
