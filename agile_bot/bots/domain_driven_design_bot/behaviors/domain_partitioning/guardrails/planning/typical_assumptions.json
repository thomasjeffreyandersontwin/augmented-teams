  "description": "Typical assumptions for domain partitioning behavior",
  "assumptions": [
    "Entities require identity management beyond simple attributes",
    "Value objects are immutable and shared across entities",
    "Aggregates should be small enough to maintain consistency boundaries",
    "Aggregate roots are the only entry points for accessing aggregate contents",
    "Domain services encapsulate business logic that doesn't fit in entities",
    "Domain events support asynchronous integration across contexts",
    "Repositories provide business-specific interfaces, beyond generic CRUD",
    "Bounded contexts ensure consistency of domain language and model",
    "Partitioning decisions should be based on business questions, not technical assumptions",
    "Design constraints (immutability for value objects, identity operations for entities) must be followed"
