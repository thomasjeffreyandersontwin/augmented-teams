  "assumptions": [
    "Domain exploration happens after story exploration stage in story shaping",
    "Acceptance criteria from story exploration are the primary input for creating behavioral acceptance criteria",
    "Behavioral acceptance criteria use the format 'When <trigger> Then <outcome>'",
    "Domain descriptions explain how concepts interact using the form '<A Concept> <interacts with> <another Concept>'",
    "Domain model and description are updated based on behavioral acceptance criteria and domain descriptions",
    "Domain exploration creates a domain exploration document similar to story exploration documents",
    "Domain graph is updated with behavioral acceptance criteria, domain descriptions, and updated domain concepts",
    "Focus on domain concepts that appear in acceptance criteria",
    "Domain descriptions should use natural language that domain experts understand",
    "Behavioral acceptance criteria should specify outcomes that result from user and system triggers"
