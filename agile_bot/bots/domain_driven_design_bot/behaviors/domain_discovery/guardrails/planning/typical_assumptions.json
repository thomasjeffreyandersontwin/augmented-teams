  "description": "Typical assumptions for domain discovery behavior",
  "assumptions": [
    "Domain discovery focuses on understanding relationships and responsibilities, not partitioning into DDD structures",
    "Story map is the primary source for identifying domain objects",
    "Relationships discovered should inform story changes for the slice if appropriate",
    "Story refinements should maintain story independence and testability",
    "Domain objects discovered are business concepts, not technical implementations",
    "Focus on core domain objects that appear frequently in stories",
    "Relationships should be expressed in domain language, not technical terms, but can still be highly specific in terms of cardinality"
