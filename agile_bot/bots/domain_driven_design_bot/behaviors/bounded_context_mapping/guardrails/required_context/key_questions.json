  "questions": [
    "Do different parts of the business think about the same thing differently? (Where do similar concepts get represented in different ways, or where the same terms can mean different things?)",
    "Does the state of something need to be different in different areas? (For example, do we care about very different things when managing a lead versus managing a real customer?)",
    "How related are things transactionally? (Do transactions occur at dramatically different rates?)",
    "How coupled are these concepts from a business perspective? (Which domain concepts get updated together as a single cohesive unit? Which get updated separately?)",
    "What are the most important subject areas of the business? (What are the concrete business concepts that matter to stakeholders who directly serve the market?)",
    "Are there regulatory or compliance requirements that span multiple domains but should be in their own bounded context?",
    "Do different market actors (customer segments, user personas) have different enough needs to warrant separate bounded contexts?",
    "What events flow between bounded contexts? (From event storming map - which events cross context boundaries?)",
    "What are the team structures and ownership? (Which teams, departments, or communities should own which bounded contexts?)"
