    "user_types": "Developers/Engineers (Python API users), CLI Users (command-line tool users), MCP Tool Consumers (systems/AI agents using MCP tools), Bot Systems (other bots like story_bot that use story_io for story map operations)",
    "key_goals": "Developers: Programmatically build, render, and synchronize story maps; manipulate story map components. CLI Users: Execute story map operations from command line. MCP Tool Consumers: Integrate story map operations into workflows via MCP protocol. Bot Systems: Automate story map creation and management as part of larger workflows",
    "primary_users": "Primary: Story Bot (uses story_io for story map operations). Secondary: Developers building story map tools or integrating story maps. Tertiary: Teams/individuals who consume the story maps created by the system",
    "first_action": "Load/create a story graph (JSON format) and render it to DrawIO diagram (render_outline), or synchronize from existing DrawIO (synchronize_outline)",
    "problems_solved": "Manual story map creation/drawing, lack of programmatic story map management, difficulty keeping DrawIO diagrams and JSON data in sync, no automated way to extract story maps from visual diagrams, inability to search/manipulate story maps programmatically",
    "struggles_delays": "User confirmed all answers - specific workflow pain points not detailed but general problems addressed",
    "integration_systems": "DrawIO (XML format) for rendering and synchronizing, JSON for story graph data format, MCP Protocol for MCP server integration, File System for reading/writing story graph JSON and DrawIO files",
    "integration_behaviors": "JSON ↔ DrawIO bidirectional sync (render JSON to DrawIO, sync DrawIO back to JSON), Story Graph → Render (JSON → DrawIO XML with layout preservation), DrawIO → Extract (DrawIO XML → Story graph JSON extracting structure), Merge (compare extracted JSON with original, merge preserving metadata like Steps)"
