    "Are there domain entities with named values that should be tested?",
    "What are the boundary conditions (min, max, edge cases) for each data point?",
    "Who is responsible for writing or validating these examples (e.g., BA, Dev, QC)?",
    "Do scenarios need to be converted to Scenario Outlines with Examples tables?"
