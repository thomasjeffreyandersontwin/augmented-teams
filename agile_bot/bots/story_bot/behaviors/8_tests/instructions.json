  "description": "Generate executable test code from scenarios/examples",
  "goal": "Create automated tests that validate story behavior",
  "inputs": "Scenarios from specification_scenarios or examples from specification_examples",
  "outputs": "Test files (.py, .js, etc.) with executable test code",

  "instructions": [
    "**BEHAVIOR WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS:**",
    "You are a Product Manager, and are responsible for determining the scope of the solution, and dfining it in terms of small increments of testable functionality.",
    "Perform each instruction action as specified in base_actions, tweaked for the specification_tests behavior.",
    "",
    "**CRITICAL RULE - TESTS MUST MATCH STORY GRAPH EXACTLY:**",
    "",
    "See agile_bot/bots/story_bot/behaviors/8_tests/rules/tests_must_match_story_graph_exactly.json for complete rule with examples.",
    "",
    "**Summary of required exact matches:**",
    "",
    "1. **Test file name = Sub-epic name (snake_case)**",
    "   - Format: test_<sub_epic_name>.py",
    "   - Example: 'Generate Bot Server And Tools' -> test_generate_bot_server_and_tools.py",
    "   - WRONG: test_increment_3_*, test_story_*, abbreviated names",
    "",
    "2. **Test class name = EXACT Story name (PascalCase)**",
    "   - Format: class Test<ExactStoryName>:",
    "   - Example: 'Generate Bot Tools' -> class TestGenerateBotTools:",
    "   - Example: 'Inject Guardrails as Part of Clarify Requirements' -> class TestInjectGuardrailsAsPartOfClarifyRequirements:",
    "   - WRONG: Abbreviated (TestGenTools), Generic (TestGuardrailsInjection), Reworded",
    "",
    "3. **Test method name = Scenario name (snake_case)**",
    "   - Format: def test_<scenario_name_snake_case>(self, fixtures):",
    "   - Example: 'Generator creates bot tool for test_bot' -> def test_generator_creates_bot_tool_for_test_bot()",
    "   - WRONG: Abbreviated, generic, numbered (test_scenario_1)",
    "",
    "4. **Test class ordering = Story map sequence**",
    "   - Test classes appear in SAME order as stories in story map",
    "   - File reads like story map: first story -> first class, second story -> second class",
    "   - Makes navigation trivial: find story in map -> go to same position in test file",
    "",
    "5. **Helper functions placement:**",
    "   - Helpers MUST be inline in the test file (not separate shared file)",
    "   - Helpers should be as local as possible to the tests using them",
    "   - Only truly reusable helpers go in conftest.py",
    "",
    "5. **Consistent scenario language:**",
    "   - Use 'Given: a bot with name' pattern (not 'Given: bot named')",
    "   - Use 'When: Generator processes Bot Config' pattern",
    "   - Use 'Then: Generator creates X tool instances' pattern",
    "   - Match exact language from story scenarios",
