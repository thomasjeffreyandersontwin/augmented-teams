Instructions:
- Use (E) for Epics and Sub-Epics
- Use (S) for Stories
- Use (AC) for Acceptance Criteria
- Story Groups are MANDATORY - all stories must be in a story group
- Story group TYPE is determined by the connector on stories WITHIN the group (and | or | opt)
- Story group CONNECTOR appears on a line by itself BETWEEN groups (and | or | opt)
- Default group type is "and" (no connector on first story in group)
- First story group in a sub-epic has NO connector line before it
- Group connector line (e.g., "or", "and") separates story groups
- Within a group, all stories share the same type (and, or, or opt)
- Show actors with "--> " before story names (e.g., "Human --> Story Name")
- Use hierarchical indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- Acceptance criteria are nested under stories with same indentation pattern
- Use active behavioral language (verb-noun format)
- Epic/Sub-Epic names: Verb-Noun format (actor NOT in name)
- Story names: Actor-Verb-Noun format (actor in story with "-->")
- Epics and Sub-Epics do NOT have connectors (only story groups have connectors)
