    "What system reactions are expected for each user input?",
    "Are we capturing both behavioral (user-system) and domain (concept-relationship) criteria?",
    "Where do we 'pass the ball' between the user and system in this flow?",
    "What are the likely unknowns, edge cases, or domain complexities?",
    "Are there domain rules or constraints that govern this behavior?",
    "Do we need to split or merge stories based on how many acceptance criteria arise?",
    "Is this increment too large? Should it be broken into smaller increments?",
    "What is the right amount of acceptance criteria for each story?",
    "How will we walk through the first acceptance criteria to confirm clarity and alignment?",
    "What parts of this increment are likely to involve integration or coordination across systems?",
    "Where might technical uncertainty or architectural complexity push us toward more granular stories or smaller increments?"
