  "typical_assumptions": [
    "Focus on user flow over internal systems",
    "Cover the end-to-end scenario",
    "Prioritize customer-facing features",
    "Assume stories should be independently testable",
    "Assume each story delivers user value",
    "Assume technical infrastructure stories are implicit",
    "Drill down where architectural uncertainty is high – unknown integration patterns, new technology, or unclear system boundaries require deeper exploration",
    "Drill down where business complexity is significant – complex business rules, regulatory requirements, or domain logic that needs clarification",
    "Drill down where uniqueness creates risk – novel approaches, first-of-kind features, or untested patterns benefit from detailed shaping",
    "Drill down where integration complexity exists – multiple systems, data dependencies, or coordination challenges need detailed mapping",
    "Drill down where user behavior is highly variable – diverse user needs, multiple personas, or inconsistent workflows require deeper understanding",
    "Skip deep drill-down where patterns are well-established – standard CRUD operations, familiar workflows, or proven integration patterns can stay high-level"
