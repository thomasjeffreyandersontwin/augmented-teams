For every two full degrees of success, the explo- sive deals +5 damage to the structure. Failure means the explosive does not go off as planned, while more than one degree of failure means the charge goes off while you are setting it! In all cases, the explosive deals normal damage to all other targets. You can make an explosive device more difficult to dis- arm. To do so, choose a disarm difficulty class before mak- ing your check to set the detonator. Your DC to set the detonator is the desired disarm DC. Failure means the explosive fails to go off as planned. Two or more degrees of failure mean the explosive goes off as the detonator is being installed! Disarming an explosive also requires a Technology check. The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the deto- nator chose a higher disarm DC (previously). If you fail the check, you do not disarm the explosive. With more than a degree of failure, the explosive goes off. Setting or disarm- ing a detonator is a standard action. INVENTING If you have the Inventor advantage (see the Advantages chapter), you can use Technology to create inventions, temporary devices. See Inventing, page 211, for details. SECURITY You can use Technology to disarm or sabotage various security devices, including locks, traps, and sensors. This takes at least a minute, possibly longer, at the GM’s dis- cretion. The GM makes your Technology check secretly so you don’t necessarily know right away if you have suc- ceeded. The Gamemaster sets the DC of the check based on the level of security: SECURITY LEVELS DC SECURITY EXAMPLE 10 Simple lock or home alarm system 15 Quality lock or home alarm system 20 Business and corporate security 25 High security: branch bank vault, museum 30 Very high security: bank headquarters vault, medium prison 35 Maximum security: highly secure prison 40 Super-max security: super-prison MODIFIERS Preventing your tampering +5 from being noticed.
