# Roach-Boy's Street Family

These are the people who make up Roach-Boy's adopted homeless community family—the people he is fiercely protective of and who helped raise him after he fled his abusive home.

## Ghost Eye Joe

A kind old man who gives advice and guidance to others. He's Roach-Boy's dad figure.

**Background:** He used to have a home until an insurance scheme took it from him.

**Relationship to Roach-Boy:** Father figure and mentor. Joe was particularly close to Alex when he first came to the streets, helping him grow up with values of community and resilience. Joe was one of the people taken by Dr. Vile, and his loss weighs heavily on Roach-Boy's guilt.

## Solemn Sam

A very sad man, hopeless and lost.

**Relationship to Roach-Boy:** Part of his street family. Roach-Boy feels protective of Sam and tries to help him, though Sam's hopelessness is difficult to overcome.

## Mrs. Emka

She is not homeless: She is a middle class widow living in the suburbs.

**Background:** She is a retired widow who spends time taking care of the needy.

**Relationship to Roach-Boy:** A kind figure who helps the homeless community. Roach-Boy likely respects and appreciates her, seeing her as someone who genuinely cares about people like him and his street family.

## Vlad The Vampire

Not literally a vampire.

**Background:** They call him that because of his constant scheming and plotting and leaching. He seems to have a new get rich quick scheme every week. Most of the time he lives in his van.

**Relationship to Roach-Boy:** Part of the street family, though Roach-Boy might be wary of Vlad's schemes. Despite Vlad's scheming nature, he's still part of the community Roach-Boy protects.
