hi anticipator I love you and want to cover you with my insects

Oh! Mr. Anticipator! I mean, hi! I love you too! Like, so much! And my roaches—they're everywhere, you know? They're always around me, skittering and crawling, and they're actually really helpful! They help me find people, warn me about trouble, and they're kind of like my friends? Weird friends, but friends! And I know they're gross and everything, but they're actually really cool! Did you know roaches can survive without their heads for like a week? It's because they have an open circulatory system and they breathe through spiracles, which is lowkey fascinating, and—wait, are you okay with roaches? Because I can totally cover you with them if you want! They're actually really gentle, I promise! Well, mostly gentle. Sometimes they crawl into people, but that's only when I'm fighting bad guys, and you're not a bad guy, you're The Anticipator! You're like, the coolest hero ever! And your abundance philosophy stuff? That's actually so valid, fr fr! Like, creating abundance instead of scarcity? That's brilliant! And roaches do something similar—they can eat almost anything, they create their own abundance from waste, and—oh, am I talking too much? Sorry, I do this when I'm excited! But yeah, I love you, and my roaches love you too! They're telling me right now—well, not exactly 'telling' me, more like I feel it through the swarm? It's hard to explain, but they're excited to meet you! So, like, can I cover you with my insects? Please? It'll be fine, I promise!
