see maa man picking On a bunch of immigrants immediately jumps to their defense and starts insulting and berating him with a bunch of really good alt right anti insults

I drop from the fire escape above, roaches cushioning my fall as I land between him and the immigrants. My antennae extend from my shoulders, sensing every movement, and the roaches swarm forward, crawling up his legs and into his sleeves. A couple crawl out from under my collar, joining the swarm.

"Oh, hey! So, like, you know what's messed up? You. You're messed up. See, roaches are scavengers—we eat what's already dead or dying. But you? You're actively hunting people who are just trying to survive. That makes you worse than a roach. And I'm literally a roach, so that's saying something!"

Hey i hava america flag i use it as sleeping cover ,m wait here its showes filghy putri american flaf ripped and taggeters sing a complerety mangemf versin of start ands tripes witj eotfd changed guatranteef to offend

I'm disgusted and I reach behind me, pulling a filthy, tattered flag out seemingly from my butt, roaches skittering off it as it unfurls.

"Oh, hey! So you've got a gross flag? Cool, cool. I've got one too! See, roaches can survive on almost anything—cardboard, hair, even flags that've been... places. But at least mine's honest about being gross. Yours is just trying too hard!"

starts to sing a mangled stars and stripes forever with offensively invented lyrics

I start singing, my voice cracking and nervous, roaches skittering around me as I belt out the mangled tune.

"Oh say can you see, by the roach's early light, what so proudly we crawled while the bigots took flight! And the roaches' red glare, the bugs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our grossness was there! Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave... and also the roaches! We're everywhere! No cap!"

taunts with Taunt And Confuse power

My voice cracks and rises, the roaches around me skittering faster as I channel everything into the taunt—my words hitting like a burst, spreading out in a thirty-foot radius, every syllable designed to confuse and distract. The swarm seems to amplify my voice, making it echo weirdly, and I can feel the power activating as a reaction, triggered by his inability to attack me directly.

"Yo, bro! You can't even touch me right now, can you? That's wild! Like, you're standing there all big and tough, but you literally can't do anything to me, and that's making you so mad you can't even think straight! Skill issue, fr fr! No cap, you're cooked!"

Roach boy attacks the MAGA super villain with his Power Roach Assault

I direct the roach swarm forward, and they surge across the ground in a writhing carpet, converging on his feet. As he steps back, his boot crunches down into the mass of insects—exactly what I needed. The roaches explode upward in a coordinated assault, swarming over his legs, crawling up his body, and the sheer overwhelming sensation of thousands of tiny legs and antennae triggers the full effect of my Roach Assault power.

"See? That's what happens when you step in my friends! They don't like being stepped on, and now you're gonna be impaired, disabled, and completely unaware of what's happening! DC 18 Will save, bro—good luck with that! The roaches are in your clothes, in your hair, everywhere! You're cooked, fr!"

Roach boy attacks the MAGA super villain with his Power Roach Assault

I watch the roaches swarm over him, antennae twitching as I sense their movement through the swarm connection. A couple more crawl out from under my sleeves, joining the assault.

"Okay, okay, that's working—totally working! The swarm's got him good, and now he's gonna be impaired and confused, which is exactly what you get for picking on people who can't fight back! DC 18 Will save, bro—hope you rolled high!"


I leap off the ground onto a lamp post and over a couple of roofs

I push off the ground, roaches trailing behind me in a dark cloud as I arc through the air. I land on the lamppost, antennae twitching to sense vibrations, then spring to the first rooftop and then the next, my body moving with that weird roach-flexibility.

"Okay, okay, that worked—totally worked! The swarm's keeping up, which is good, because I really need the mobility right now!"


as I'm leaping over the rooftops I'm suddenly attacked by 1/2 rodent half scarecrow pest looking thing it barely misses me

I twist mid-air as something lunges at me—my antennae twitch, sensing the attack before it connects. I drop low, roaches scattering around me like a living shield, and the thing's claws swipe just over my head. A couple roaches crawl out from under my sleeves, joining the defensive swarm.

"Whoa, whoa, what the—okay, that was way too close! What even IS that thing? Half rodent, half scarecrow? That's messed up, and I should know, because I'm literally part roach!"


roach boy dodges elephant man and makes fun of him

I twist mid-air as Elephant Man lunges—my antennae twitch, sensing the attack before it connects. I drop low, roaches scattering around me like a living shield, and his massive swing goes wide. A couple roaches crawl out from under my sleeves, joining the defensive swarm.

"Whoa, whoa, nice try! But, like, did you get dressed in the dark, or is that just your natural look? Because honestly, you're giving 'trying way too hard' energy, and your aim is about as good as your fashion sense—which is to say, terrible!"
