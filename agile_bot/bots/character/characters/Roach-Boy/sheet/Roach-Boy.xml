				<description>In the sprawling cityscape, where the forgotten corners were home to those neglected by society, a young boy named Alex found an unexpected family.
Fleeing from the torment of an abusive household and a blind system that kept returning him to his tormentors, a very young Alex sought refuge in the streets. Here, among the homeless and the destitute, he found kindness and a sense of
belonging that had eluded him all his life. This makeshift family, led by a wise and kind mentor figure who became particularly close to Alex, helped ALex grow up with the values of community and resilience.

This peace was shattered when Dr. Vile, a shadowy figure obsessed with creating superhumans through genetic experimentation with various ruban pests, targeted the homeless as his subjects. One fateful night, Alex's newfound family was ambushed and several of them, including his mentor, were taken. In the ensuing chaos, Alex found himself dragged
into Dr. Vile's hidden laboratory beneath the city. Here, he was subjected to a series of bizarre experiments that altered his genetic makeup, fusing his DNA with that of cockroaches.

The experiments bestowed upon Alex incredible abilities. He found himself able to communicate with and control cockroaches, and his body had gained their resilience and strength. Seizing an opportunity amidst the madness of the lab,
Alex used his newfound powers to escape. Yet, in his frantic bid for freedom, he left behind those who had been taken with him, including his mentor.

Once safe, the gravity of his actions set in. Consumed by guilt for abandoning his adopted family, Alex vowed to use his powers to make amends. He returned to Dr. Vile's lab, determined to rescue them, only iIt was too late; there were no
survivors. This devastating discovery cemented Alex's resolve. He became Roach-Boy, a guardian of the city's underbelly, dedicated to protecting the vulnerable and fighting against those who preyed on them.

As Roach-Boy, Alex patrols the streets, using his unique abilities to safeguard the homeless community, especially those who had become his second family. He is driven by the memory of his mentor and the haunting guilt of his failure to save
them. This guilt transformed into a relentless determination to never leave anyone behind again.

Despite his noble intentions, Roach-Boy's appearance and powers often lead to misunderstandings. His insect-like abilities
and his affinity with cockroaches disgust many, and he is frequently mistaken for a monster or villlain. 

The public's fear and the media's sensationalism make his mission even more challenging. Yet, he perseveres, finding solace in the small victories and the grateful smiles of those he helps.

Roach-Boy's battle against injustice extends beyond the streets. He tirelessly seeks to thwart Dr. Vile's ongoing experiments vowing to put an end to the mad scientist's reign of terror. His encounters with Dr. Vile are both fierce and dangerous, but Roach-Boy's resolve will never waver.

 Roach-boy is a hero born from tragedy and transformed by his unyielding desire to right the wrongs of his past. In the heart
of the city's underbelly, Roach-Boy has become more than just a superhero; he is a symbol of hope for the downtrodden
and a reminder that someone is fighting for them.</description>

				<skill name="Acrobatics" attrbonus="2" value="+12/+4" base="2" trainedonly="yes">
					<description>Use Acrobatics to flip, dive, roll, tumble, and perform other acrobatic maneuvers, as well as keeping your balance under difficult circumstances.

Balancing: You can keep your balance and move along a precarious surface at your ground speed minus 1 rank with a successful Acrobatics check against the surface's DC. A degree of failure indicates you spend your move action just maintaining your balance and do not actually move, while two or more degrees of failure means you lose your balance and fall. You are vulnerable while balancing. If you accept a +5 increase to the Acrobatics DC, you are not vulnerable.

Maneuvering: You can make Acrobatics checks for various acrobatic stunts or maneuvers, from back flips to jumping over an opponent (to get behind them), flipping up onto a ledge, tumbling through obstacles, and so forth. The GM sets the DC. Success means you accomplish the maneuver.

Standing: You can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to go from prone to standing as a free action rather than a move action. A failed check means you remain prone.

Tumbling: You can make an Acrobatics check (DC 5) to lessen damage from a fall, reducing the damage by 1 per degree. A fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you quickly roll to your feet as a free action. Otherwise, you are prone at the end of a fall.</description>

				</skill>
				<skill name="Athletics" attrbonus="5" value="+5" base="-">
					<description>Use Athletics for physical feats like climbing, jumping, riding animal mounts, and swimming.

Climbing: With a successful Athletics check, you can climb along a slope, wall, or other steep incline at your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface can't be climbed without the Wall-crawling effect of Movement (see the Powers chapter).

Jumping: The result of an Athletics check is the distance (in feet) you can clear in a running long-jump. If you make a standing jump, divide the distance in half. If you make a vertical jump (straight up) divide the distance by 5, and if you make a standing vertical jump, divide it by 10. Your Athletics bonus + 10 is the base distance you can jump under routine circumstances.

Running: You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to run faster: success increases your ground speed rank by +1 for one round.

Swimming: A successful DC 10 Athletics check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the check fails, you make no progress through the water during the action. With more than one degree of failure, you go under. If underwater, you must hold your breath to avoid drowning.</description>

				<skill name="Close Combat: Roach Combat" attrbonus="2" value="+12" base="10">
					<description>You're trained with a particular type of close attack, giving you a bonus to your attack checks with it equal to your skill rank (see Attack Check in The Basics and in the Action &amp; Adventure chapter). Each close attack is a separate Close Combat skill with its own rank, and encompasses a single weapon or power, although an array may be considered one power, at the Gamemaster's discretion (see Arrays in the Powers chapter for more information).</description>
					<cost text="5 PP" value="5"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Deception" attrbonus="1" value="+1" base="-">
					<description>Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you want them to believe. It covers things like acting, bluffing, fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge. Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story.

Bluffing: Make a Deception check to tell a believable lie or get someone do go along with you. A bluff is usually opposed by the target's Deception or Insight check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome.

Disguise: You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change your appearance. Your Deception check result determines the effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others' Perception check results. The GM makes the Deception check secretly, so you are not sure exactly how well your disguise holds up under scrutiny.

Feinting: You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a standard action. If your Deception check succeeds, the target is vulnerable against your next attack, until the end of your next round (see Vulnerable in the Conditions section of The Basics chapter).

Innuendo: You can use Deception to send covert messages using wordplay and double-meanings while apparently talking about other things. The DC for a basic message is 10. Complex messages or messages trying to communicate new information have DCs of 15 or 20, respectively. The recipient of the message must make an Insight check against the same DC to understand it.

Tricking: You can use Deception to mislead an opponent into taking a potentially unwise action, such as trying to hit you while standing in front of an electrical junction box or at the edge of a precipice. If your Deception check opposed by Deception or Insight succeeds, your opponent is heedless of the potential danger and may hit the junction box or lose his balance and fall, if his attack against you fails.</description>

					<description>Expertise is a broad skill encompassing knowledge and training in a variety of specialized fields, particularly professional disciplines and scholarship. Each is considered a separate skill and training in each is acquired separately, so a former police officer turned district attorney might have Expertise: Police Officer and Expertise: Law, each with their own ranks, for example.

				</skill>
				<skill name="Insight" attrbonus="2" value="+2" base="-">
					<description>You can tell someone's true intentions and feelings by paying attention to things like body language, inflection, and your own intuition.

Detect Illusion: The GM makes a secret Insight check to determine if your hero senses the true nature of an illusion (DC 10 + Illusion rank). Success means you pick up on a flaw in the illusion, sensing it is not real. See the Illusion effect in the Powers chapter for details.

Detect Influence: You can make an Insight check to notice someone acting under outside influence. The DC is 10 + the rank of the effect or skill affecting the subject. If you succeed, you notice the subject is not acting entirely of his or her own will. Three or more degrees give you a general idea of what is influencing them (and perhaps even whom, depending on the situation and the Gamemaster's  judgment).

Evaluate: With an Insight check, opposed by Deception, you can tell if someone is trustworthy and honorable (or not) upon meeting them. You can also make an Insight check (DC 20) to evaluate a social situation, getting a feel for the overall mood and prevailing attitudes. Two or more degrees of failure on either check mean you misinterpret the signs, so the GM may make these checks for you in secret.

Innuendo: You can use Insight to pick up on hidden messages sent via the Deception skill (see the Deception skill description).

Resist Influence: Make an Insight check when called to do so to resist or overcome the effects of certain interaction skills, such as Deception or Intimidation. If the result of your check exceeds your opponent's, you are unaffected by their attempt to influence you.</description>
					<cost text="0 PP" value="0"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Intimidation" attrbonus="1" value="+1" base="-">
					<description>You know how to use threats (both real and implied) to get others to do what you want.

Coercing: Make an Intimidation check, opposed by the target's Insight or Will defense (whichever has the highest bonus). If your check succeeds, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for actions taken in your presence. That is, the target retains his normal attitude, but will talk, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. The target cooperates, but won't necessarily obey your every whim or do anything that would directly endanger him.

Demoralizing: You can use Intimidation in combat as a standard action to undermine an opponent's confidence. Make an Intimidation check as a standard action. If it succeeds, your target is impaired (a -2 circumstance penalty on checks) until the end of your next round. With four or more degrees of success, the target is disabled (a -5 penalty) until the end of your next round.

Intimidating Minions: You can intimidate a whole group of minions - who can all see and hear you - with a single check. If the group has you at a disadvantage, you suffer the usual circumstance penalty on your check. Compare your check result against a single resistance check made by the GM for the entire group. Your Intimidation check must have the same effect on every member of the group.</description>
					<cost text="0 PP" value="0"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Investigation" attrbonus="2" value="-" base="-" trainedonly="yes" usable="no">
					<description>You know how to search for and study clues, gather information through interviews and surveillance, and analyze evidence to help solve crimes. The GM may make Investigation checks for you in secret, so you do not know exactly what you have found, or if you may have missed something.

Search: You can search an area for clues, hidden items, traps, and other details. Perception allows you to immediately notice things, while an Investigation check allows you to pick up on details with some effort.

Gather Evidence: To collect a piece of evidence for analysis, make an Investigation check (DC 15). If the check succeeds, the evidence can be analyzed (see the following). If the check fails, an analysis can be done, but with a -5 penalty for highly unfavorable circumstances. With more than one degree of failure, the evidence is ruined and no analysis can be done. On the other hand, two or more degrees of success provide a +2 circumstance bonus to later analysis.

Analyze Evidence: You can make an Investigation check to apply forensic knowledge to evidence. This function of Investigation does not give you clues where none exist. It simply allows you to extract useful information from evidence and clues you have found.

Gather Information: You know how to make contacts, collect gossip and rumors, question informants, and otherwise get information from people.

Surveillance: You can set up surveillance of a particular area, watching from a stationary location. The DC of the subject's Stealth check to evade your notice is equal to the result of your Investigation check. For actively following a subject, see Tailing in the Stealth skill description.</description>
					<cost text="0 PP" value="0"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Perception" attrbonus="2" value="+2" base="-">
					<description>Use this skill to notice and pick up on things. Discerning details - such as clearly hearing conversation or reading fine text - requires at least three degrees of success on the Perception check.

Hearing: Make a check against a DC based on how loud the noise is or against an opposed Stealth check. Normal conversation is DC 0, a soft noise DC 10. Listening through a door is +5 DC, +15 for a solid wall. While you're asleep, hearing something well enough to wake up is +10 DC.

Seeing: Make a check against a DC based on how visible the object is or against an opposed Stealth check. Something in plain sight is DC 0, while something subtle or easily overlooked may be DC 5, 10 or more. Visual perception is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Deception skill) or to notice a concealed object (see the Sleight of Hand skill).

Other Senses: You can make Perception checks involving other sense types as well (see the Powers chapter for more on sense types). Noticing something obvious to a sense is DC 0. Less obvious things are DC 10 or so, hidden things DC 20 or more, and discerning details requires at least three degrees of success, as usual.</description>
					<cost text="0 PP" value="0"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Persuasion" attrbonus="1" value="+1" base="-">
					<description>You're skilled in dealing with people, from etiquette and social graces to a way with words and public speaking, all of which helps to get your point across, make a good impression, negotiate, and generally win people over to your way of seeing things. In negotiations, all participants roll Persuasion checks to see who gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve cases where two advocates plead opposing cases before a third party. Non-player characters each have an initial attitude towards you or your cause. The GM chooses the character's initial attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, people are favorable or indifferent toward heroes, but a specific circumstance or complication may call for a different attitude.</description>
					<cost text="0 PP" value="0"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Sleight of Hand" attrbonus="2" value="-" base="-" trainedonly="yes" usable="no">
					<description>You can perform dexterous feats of legerdemain such as palming small objects, picking pockets, slipping out of restraints, and so forth. Stage magicians use Sleight of Hand legitimately as a performance skill, but it is most commonly known for its criminal applications.

Concealing: You can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small item on your person, making your check result the DC of an Investigation or Perception check to find it.

Contorting: Make a DC 30 Sleight of Hand check to fit through a tight space wide enough for your head but too narrow for the width of your shoulders, or to reach through an opening wide enough for your hand, but too narrow for your arm.

Escaping: Make a Sleight of Hand check to slip out of various restraints. This takes at least a minute per check.

Legerdemain: Minor feats of Sleight of Hand, such as making a coin or playing card 'vanish', have a DC of 10 unless an observer is focused on noticing what you are doing. When you perform this skill under observation, your check is opposed by the observer's Perception check to see if they notice the trick.

Stealing: To covertly take something from another person make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 20). Your target makes a Perception check and notices the attempt if his check result beats yours, whether you succeed in taking the object or not. You can also make a Sleight of Hand check to plant a small object on someone, slip  something into their pocket, drop something into their drink, place a tiny radio tracer on them, and so forth.</description>
					<cost text="0 PP" value="0"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Stealth" attrbonus="2" value="+3" base="1">
					<description>You're skilled in going unnoticed. While using Stealth, you can move at your speed rank minus 1 with no penalty. Faster than that, up to your full speed, you take a -5 circumstance penalty to your Stealth checks.

Hiding: If you have cover or concealment, make a Stealth check, opposed by an observer's Perception check, to hide and go unnoticed.

Tailing: You can use Stealth to tail someone at your normal speed. This assumes you have some cover or concealment (crowds of people, shadows, fog, etc.). If the subject is worried about being followed, he can make a Perception check (opposed by your Stealth check) every time he changes course (goes around a street corner, exits a building, and so on). If he is unsuspecting, he only gets one Perception check for the scene.</description>
					<cost text="0.5 PP" value="0.5"/>
				</skill>
				<skill name="Technology" attrbonus="2" value="-" base="-" trainedonly="yes" usable="no">
					<description>Technology covers operating, building, repairing, and generally working with technological devices and equipment. Without the proper tools or equipment, you take a -5 penalty to Technology checks for highly unfavorable circumstances.

Operating: Most routine operations of technological equipment don't require a skill check and can be done untrained. Using an unfamiliar device does require a check, with the DC determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from simple (DC 10) to highly advanced (DC 25 or more).

Building: The difficulty and time required to make an item depends on its complexity, as shown on the Building Items table. If your Technology check succeeds, you have made the item after the necessary time.

Repairing: You can also use Technology to repair damaged items, with a -5 to the DC to build the item and -2 to the time rank required. So you can perform repairs on a complex item in eight hours (time rank 12) with a DC of 20.

Jury-rigging: You can also attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. Doing this reduces the repair DC by an additional 5 (for a total of -10 to the DC to build the item), and allows you to make the Technology check as a standard action. However, a jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem, and the repair only lasts until the end of the scene.

Demolitions: Careful placement of an explosive against a fixed structure can maximize damage by exploiting vulnerabilities in the structure. This requires at least a minute and a DC 10 Technology check. The GM makes the check, so you don't know exactly how well you have done until the explosive goes off.

Inventing: If you have the Inventor advantage (see the Advantages chapter), you can use Technology to create inventions, temporary devices. See Inventing, page 145, for details.

Security: You can use Technology to disarm or sabotage various security devices, including locks, traps, and sensors. This takes at least a minute, possibly longer, at the GM's discretion. The GM makes your Technology check secretly, so you don't necessarily know right away if you have succeeded.</description>

				<skill name="Treatment" attrbonus="2" value="-" base="-" trainedonly="yes" usable="no">
					<description>You're trained in treating injuries and ailments.

Diagnosis: You can diagnose injuries and ailments with an eye toward further treatment. This takes at least a minute. At the GM's discretion, a successful diagnosis provides a +2 bonus for favorable circumstances on further Treatment checks.

Provide Care: Providing care means treating an injured patient for a day or more. If successful, the patient further reduces the recovery time by 1 rank (see Recovery in the Action &amp; Adventure chapter). You can provide care for up to your Treatment rank in patients at one time.

Revive: You can remove the dazed or stunned conditions from a subject (see Conditions in the Action &amp; Adventure chapter). The check to revive is a standard action. A successful check removes the condition.

Stabilize: As a standard action, a successful Treatment check stabilizes a dying character.

Treat Disease and Poison: You can treat a character afflicted with a disease or poison. Each time the character makes a resistance check against the ailment, you make a Treatment check. One degree of success provides the patient with a +2 circumstance bonus to the resistance check, three or more degrees of success provides a +5 circumstance bonus.</description>

Routine tasks, such as ordinary operation of known vehicles, don't require a check and may even be done untrained for some vehicles, particularly common ones like cars.

You do not suffer any damage from landing after a jump, so long as it is within your maximum distance.

The speed rank of your leap maxes out at 7 (around 250 miles per hour), so leaps of greater than distance rank 7 take time equal to the distance rank minus 7. For example, a massive leap of 500 miles (distance rank 17) takes time rank 10 (17 - 7, or two hours) of time in the air! Because of this, leapers may choose to make shorter 'hops' of just a couple miles, leaving them airborne for only a minute or so, to better control their direction.</description>

							<description>You recover quickly from damage. Remove penalties to your Toughness checks due to damage equal to your Regeneration rank each minute. You then recover other damage conditions equal to your Regeneration rank each minute, starting from your most severe condition. Spread this recovery out evenly over a minute (10 action rounds). So with Regeneration 5, you remove a -1 Toughness penalty every other round (every round with Regeneration 10, and up to a -2 penalty per round with Regeneration 20).

Characters with no Stamina do not heal (see Absent Abilities in the Abilities chapter). One or more ranks of Regeneration overcome this. An absent Stamina character with Regeneration 1 recovers at a normal rate; additional Regeneration ranks speed up that rate.</description>

									<description>Each effect has a default action required to use it: standard, free, or none (for permanent effects). This modifier changes an effect's required action from a standard or free to a reaction, occurring automatically when a specific triggering event occurs. This is similar to the Triggered modifier (later in this section) but reaction effects do not need to be 'set', originate from their user, and can function repeatedly, so long as their triggering requirement is met.

Specify a triggering circumstance that activates the effect, such as someone touching or attacking the user, activating a particular effect or power in the user's presence, and so forth. The GM is the final arbiter as to whether or not a triggering circumstance is suitable for a particular effect in the context of the series. Caution should be used to keep this option from being abused.

									<description>An effect with this flaw is not effective all the time. Limited powers generally break down into two types: those usable only in certain situations and those usable only on certain things. For example Only While Singing Loudly, Only While Flying, Only on Men (or Women), Only Against Fire, Not Usable on Yellow Things, and so forth. As a general rule, the effect must lose about half its usefulness to qualify for this modifier. Anything less limiting is better handled as an occasional complication.</description>

								<flaw name="Sense-dependent: Hearing" info="Hearing">
									<description>The target of a Sense-dependent effect must be able to perceive the effect for it to work. The target gets a Dodge resistance check. Success means the target has managed to avert his eyes, cover his ears, etc. and the effect doesn't work. Otherwise the effect works normally and the target makes the usual resistance check against it, if any.

Opponents aware of a Sense-dependent effect can also deliberately block the targeted sense: looking away, covering or blocking their ears, etc. This provides a +10 bonus to resistance checks against the effect, but gives others partial concealment from that sense. An opponent unable to use a sense (blind, deaf, etc.) is immune to effects dependent on it. Opponents can do this by closing their eyes, wearing ear- or nose-plugs, or using another effect like Concealment. This gives you total concealment from that sense.

Sensory effects are Sense-dependent by definition, and cannot apply this flaw. To give a target additional resistance to a sensory effect, use the Resistible flaw.</description>

					<description>You gain total concealment from a particular sense while this effect is active, although you are still detectable to other senses (even other senses of the same sense type; so you could have full concealment against normal sight, but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense type). Each additional rank gives you concealment from another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an entire sense type.

Concealment from visual senses costs double (2 ranks for one visual sense, 4 ranks for all visual senses). You cannot have concealment from tactile senses, since that requires being incorporeal (see the Insubstantial effect). So with Concealment 5, you can have total concealment from all visual senses (4 ranks) and normal hearing (1 rank), for example. With Concealment 10 you have total concealment from all sense types other than tactile.</description>

Roach-boy in his defense of the homeless has interfered numerous times with DOUSe, who also have a special department that deals with super powered pests eg Sewer Reptile Monsters, Rodent and Bat Creatures, and yes of course Insect powered nusiances.</description>

					<description>Roach- Boy's appearance and powers bring about disgust in almost everyone. He is shunned by every day people. He is often mistaken as a villain, and police will often fire at him on sight. The tablid press love to right fabricated stories about his monstrous acts.

					<description>Roach-Boy was informally adopted by a tight night group of home-less / near homeless people from a very young age, when he was fleeing an abusive family, and an unsympathetic system. 

Roach-boy is extremely protective of this group of people and of homeless people in general. He is also an active defender of the poor and people who are just on the fringe of becoming destitute. He spends a good portion of his time at holmeless shelters and food banks, helping in any way he can.

Roach-boy in particular is commited to improving the lives of his adopted troup of street folks, doing what he can to get them of the street.</description>
