RULES vs DECISION CRITERIA ANALYSIS
====================================

GENERIC RULES (Always Apply - Not Strategy-Based)
--------------------------------------------------
These rules apply regardless of decision criteria choices:

- focus_real_actions_on_domain_concepts.json - Verb-noun format, real actions
- use_active_behavioral_language.json - Active language
- avoid_noun_redundancy.json - Avoid redundancy
- use_outcome_verbs_not_communication_verbs.json - Outcome verbs
- prevent_generic_capabilities.json - Prevent generic capabilities
- avoid_technical_stories.json - Avoid technical stories (unless needed)
- identify_system_stories.json - Identify system stories properly
- create_lightweight_precise_docs.json - Lightweight docs


STRATEGY-BASED RULES (Tied to Decision Criteria)
--------------------------------------------------

1. DRILL-DOWN APPROACH → Rules:
   - extract_story_map_from_code.json - Find outermost layer (supports "Dig deep on system interactions/architectural pieces")
   - enforce_behavioral_journey_flow.json - Journey flow (supports "Dig deep on user workflows/behavioral complexity")
   - focus_user_and_system_activities.json - User/system focus (supports "Dig deep on user workflows")

2. DEPTH OF SHAPING → Rules:
   - balance_fine_grained_testable_stories.json - Balance granularity (supports "Testable" depth)
   - size_stories_3_to_12_days.json - Story sizing (supports "Estimates" vs "Decompose" depth)

3. DRILL-DOWN LIMITS → Rules:
   - apply_7_plus_minus_2_hierarchy.json - Hierarchy limits (supports story/feature limits)

4. FLOW SCOPE AND GRANULARITY → Rules:
   - enforce_behavioral_journey_flow.json - Journey flow (supports "Journey level")
   - map_sequential_spine_vs_optional_paths.json - Spine vs optional (supports "End-to-end" vs "Journey level")
   - establish_spine_vs_optional_enhanced_behavior.json - Spine establishment (supports flow mapping)


MISSING RULES TO MAXIMIZE EACH DECISION CRITERIA
=================================================

FOR DRILL_DOWN_APPROACH:
-------------------------
- "Prioritize drill-down areas based on architectural uncertainty, business complexity, uniqueness risk, integration complexity, or variable user behavior"
- "Skip deep drill-down for well-established patterns (standard CRUD, familiar workflows, proven integrations)"

FOR DEPTH_OF_SHAPING:
---------------------
- "Apply 'Estimates' depth (story_count only) for non-drill-down areas to maintain high-level view"
- "Apply 'Decompose' depth (all stories listed) for drill-down areas to enable detailed planning"
- "Apply 'Happy Path' depth for drill-down areas when extensive scenarios would exceed limits"
- "Apply 'Extensive' depth (all scenarios) only when business complexity or uniqueness risk is high"

FOR DRILL_DOWN_LIMITS:
---------------------
- "Respect story/feature limits during shaping to prevent over-detailing and maintain focus"
- "When approaching limits, prioritize drill-down on highest-value or highest-risk areas first"

FOR FLOW_SCOPE_AND_GRANULARITY:
-------------------------------
- "For 'Journey level' scope: Map complete user journey across multiple touchpoints, systems, and interactions"
- "For 'End-to-end user-system behavior' scope: Focus on one user interaction followed by one system response"
- "For 'Integration boundary level' scope: Focus on system-to-system integration points and data flow across boundaries"
- "For 'Domain boundary level' scope: Map flows by business domain boundaries, showing how domains interact"
- "For 'Intra-system level' scope: Focus on interactions within a single system, useful for significant backend/service flows"

FOR TYPICAL_ASSUMPTIONS:
------------------------
- "Focus on user flow over internal systems when mapping stories"
- "Cover end-to-end scenario when establishing story journey"
- "Prioritize customer-facing features when selecting drill-down areas"
- "Assume stories should be independently testable when sizing and decomposing"
- "Assume each story delivers user value when establishing spine vs optional paths"
