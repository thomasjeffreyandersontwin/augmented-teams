    "**MANDATORY: Before validating any content, you MUST load and review the project's context files:**",
    "1. Load `{project_area}/docs/stories/clarification.json` - Contains key questions and evidence (generated file)",
    "2. Load `{project_area}/docs/stories/planning.json` - Contains assumptions and decisions (generated file)",

    "- **Generated files:** `{project_area}/docs/stories/clarification.json`, `{project_area}/docs/stories/planning.json`",

    "**Instructions:**",
    "1. Load and review `{project_area}/docs/stories/clarification.json` and `{project_area}/docs/stories/planning.json` to understand all requirements and decisions",
    "2. Check planning.json for the current behavior's decisions_made and assumptions_made sections",
    "3. Evaluate the Content Data against all rules listed above",
    "4. Check for violations of each rule",
    "5. Verify that Content Data incorporates all requirements from clarification.json and planning.json (especially the current behavior's decisions_made and assumptions_made)",
    "6. Generate a validation report with:",
    "   - List of all violations found (if any)",
    "   - Specific examples from the Content Data that violate rules",
    "   - Any missing requirements from clarification.json or planning.json (including stage-specific decisions/assumptions)",
    "   - Recommendations for fixing violations",
    "7. If no violations found, confirm that Content Data follows all rules and incorporates all requirements",

    "   - Location: `{project_area}/{docs_path}/validation-report.md` (validation report goes in docs_path, NOT in context folder)",

    "**CRITICAL: Verb-Noun Format Validation:**",
    "When checking verb-noun format for story/epic names:",
    "- Verb-noun format means [Verb] [Noun] structure - the verb can be in various forms (imperative 'Add', infinitive 'To Add', third person 'Adds')",
    "- DO NOT suggest pluralizing nouns unless the original is clearly grammatically incorrect",
    "- DO NOT remove important prepositional phrases or context from the noun part (e.g., 'Add Minion To Mob' is correct - don't suggest removing 'To Mob')",
    "- The format is about structure (verb + noun), not about specific verb tense or noun number",
    "- Examples of CORRECT verb-noun format: 'Add Minion To Mob', 'Create Mob', 'Group Minions', 'Select Strategy'",
    "- Examples of INCORRECT: 'Mob Management' (noun-noun, no verb), 'Adding Minion' (gerund, not action verb), 'Minion Addition' (noun-noun)",
    "",
    "**CRITICAL: Story Context and Flow Validation:**",
    "- Story order and context come from sequential_order in the story graph - if sequential_order is present, the order/context is already specified",
    "- DO NOT flag stories as 'missing context' if they have sequential_order - the order provides the context (when/why/outcome comes from position in sequence)",
    "- Flow validation (end-to-end user-system behavior, one interaction/response) will be handled in discovery phase - DO NOT flag these as violations in shape phase",
    "- In shape phase, focus on: naming format, domain concepts, story structure - NOT detailed flow/context which comes in discovery",
