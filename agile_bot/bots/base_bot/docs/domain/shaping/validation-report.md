# Domain Model Validation Report

**Domain**: Agile Bot Framework  
**Date**: 2025-12-02  
**Validated Against**: DDD Shape Behavior Rules

---

## ✅ Passed Rules

### 1. Domain Concepts Are Nouns, Behaviors Are Verbs
**Status**: PASS  
**Findings**: All domain concepts are properly named as nouns:
- Base Bot, Base Action, Specific Bot, Behavior, Project, Router, Content, Guardrails, Template, Extractor, Synchronizer, Rule

All responsibilities use verb phrases to describe behaviors:
- "Execute 7-step workflow", "Route to behaviors", "Load action instructions", etc.

### 2. Domain Responsibilities No Self-Reference
**Status**: PASS  
**Findings**: No concept references itself in its responsibility descriptions or collaborators list. All responsibilities focus on what the concept does with external collaborators.

### 3. Domain Concepts Over File Structure
**Status**: PASS  
**Findings**: Domain model focuses on business concepts (Base Bot, Behavior, Content) rather than technical file structures.

## ⚠️ Warnings

### 1. Collaborators Ordered By Call Chain
**Status**: PARTIAL PASS  
**Findings**: Most collaborators are well-ordered, but a few could be improved:

**Needs Review**:
- **Base Action** → "Execute action logic: Workflow State, Content"  
  - Suggested: "Execute action logic: Content, Workflow State" (Base Action typically produces Content first, then updates Workflow State)

- **Content** → "Render outputs: Template, Transformer"  
  - Current is correct (Template uses Transformer)

- **Guardrails** → "Guide planning decisions: Decision Criteria, Assumptions"  
  - Current is correct (Decision Criteria produce Assumptions)

**Recommendation**: Consider reordering Base Action's "Execute action logic" collaborators to reflect the typical call chain where content is produced before workflow state is updated.

## 📋 Summary

**Total Rules Checked**: 3  
**Passed**: 2  
**Warnings**: 1  
**Failed**: 0

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **GOOD**  
The domain model follows DDD best practices with clear concept-responsibility-collaborator relationships. The model successfully distinguishes between the reusable Base Bot framework and Specific Bot implementations, which is a strong architectural pattern.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear separation between Base Bot (framework) and Specific Bot (implementation)
2. All concepts are nouns representing domain entities
3. Responsibilities use active verbs describing behaviors
4. No self-references in responsibilities
5. Clean collaboration relationships

**Recommended Minor Improvements**:
1. Review collaborator ordering in "Execute action logic" responsibility for Base Action

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Accept current domain model
2. Consider minor collaborator reordering for Base Action
3. Proceed to implementation or further refinement as needed
