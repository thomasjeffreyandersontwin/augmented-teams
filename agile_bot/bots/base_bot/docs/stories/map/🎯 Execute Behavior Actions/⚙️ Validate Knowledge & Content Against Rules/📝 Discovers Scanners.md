# 📝 Discovers Scanners

**Navigation:** [📋 Story Map](../../story-map-outline.drawio) | [⚙️ Feature Overview](../../README.md)

**Epic:** Validate Knowledge & Content Against Rules  
**Feature:** Code Scanner  
**Story:** Discovers Scanners

## Story Description

System discovers scanners from rule.json files, extracts metadata, and registers them in a catalog organized by behavior name.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Behavioral Acceptance Criteria

- **When** scanner discovery is executed for rule files, **then** scanners are discovered from rule files containing scanner properties
- **When** scanner class path is found in rule file, **then** scanner class is located and validated
- **When** scanner metadata is extracted, **then** metadata includes rule_name, description, and behavior_name
- **When** scanners are registered, **then** scanners are organized in catalog grouped by behavior_name
- **When** rule file is malformed, **then** error is logged and valid scanners are still registered
- **When** scanner class is not found, **then** error is logged and scanner is not registered
- **When** rule file is missing scanner property, **then** error is logged and scanner is not registered

## Background

**Common setup steps shared across all scenarios:**

```gherkin
Given Agent is initialized with agent_name='test_story_bot'
And Project has finished generating knowledge graph
And Behavior is "<behavior_name>"
And Common rules directory exists at 'agile_bot/bots/test_story_bot/rules/'
And Behavior rules directory exists at 'agile_bot/bots/test_story_bot/behaviors/<behavior_number>_<behavior_name>/3_rules/'
```

## Scenarios

### Scenario Outline: Scanner discovery extracts metadata and registers scanners (happy_path)

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given Rule files exist at "<rule_file_paths>"
And Rule files contain "<rule_file_content>"
When Scanner discovery is executed for rule files at "<rule_file_paths>"
Then Scanners are discovered: "<registered_scanners>"
And Scanner class found status is "<scanner_class_found>"
And Scanner metadata is extracted from rule file with content "<rule_file_content>"
And Scanner metadata is "<scanner_metadata>"
And Scanners "<registered_scanners>" are registered in catalog for behaviors "<behaviors>"
And Catalog structure is "<catalog_structure>"
And Catalog size is "<catalog_size>"
```

**Examples:**
