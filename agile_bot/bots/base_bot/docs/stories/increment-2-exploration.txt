            and (AC) THEN Behavior Action loads instructions from behavior and base_actions
            and (AC) AND Action merges base instructions with behavior-specific instructions
            and (AC) AND Compiled instructions returned for injection into AI Chat

(E) Execute Behavior Actions
    (E) Gather Context
            (S) Bot Behavior --> Inject Guardrails as Part of Clarify Requirements
            and (AC) WHEN MCP Specific Behavior Action Tool invokes Gather Context Action
            and (AC) THEN Action checks for guardrails in behavior/guardrails/required_context/
            and (AC) WHEN guardrails exist, THEN Action loads key_questions.json and evidence.json
            and (AC) AND Action injects guardrails into clarify requirements section

            (S) Bot Behavior --> Inject Planning Criteria Into Instructions
            and (AC) WHEN MCP Specific Behavior Action Tool invokes Planning Action
            and (AC) THEN Action checks for guardrails in behavior/guardrails/planning/
            and (AC) WHEN guardrails exist, THEN Action loads typical_assumptions.json and decision_criteria files
