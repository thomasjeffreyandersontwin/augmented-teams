# 📝 Generate Bot Tools

**Epic:** Build Agile Bots
**Feature:** Generate Bot Server And Tools

## Story Description

MCP Server Generator creates ONE overall bot tool that reads workflow state to determine current behavior/action and executes the correct one so that users don't need to specify which behavior/action to invoke.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Behavioral Acceptance Criteria

- **When** MCP Server Generator scans base_actions/ folder, **then** Generator discovers actions by reading each action folder
- **When** Generator reads action configuration from each action folder, **then** action configuration specifies: name, workflow (true/false), order, next_action
- **When** Generator creates tools for all discovered actions, **then** Tools include workflow state awareness based on action workflow configuration flag

## Background

**Common setup steps shared across all scenarios:**

```gherkin
Given base_actions/ folder exists with action subfolders
And Generator is initialized
And action configuration schema is defined with fields: name, workflow, order, next_action
```

## Scenarios

### Scenario: Generator creates ONE bot tool with workflow state awareness

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given base_actions/ contains folders: gather_context, decide_planning_criteria, build_knowledge, render_output, validate_rules
And Bot Config defines behaviors: shape, discovery, exploration, scenarios
And Action configs specify workflow sequence and transitions
When Generator creates bot tool
Then Generator creates ONE bot tool (not separate tools per behavior/action)
And Bot tool can read workflow_state to determine current behavior/action
And Bot tool routes to correct behavior/action based on workflow state
And Bot tool uses action configuration to understand workflow transitions
```

### Scenario: Bot tool routes to workflow actions based on state

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given bot tool is created
And workflow state shows: current_action='story_bot.discovery.build_knowledge'
And build_knowledge action configuration specifies workflow=true, next_action='render_output'
When bot tool is invoked
Then Bot tool reads workflow state
And Bot tool extracts current behavior and action
And Bot tool routes to discovery.build_knowledge
And Bot tool executes build_knowledge with workflow awareness (auto-transition to render_output)
```

### Scenario: Bot tool routes to independent actions via parameter

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given bot tool is created
And correct_bot action configuration specifies workflow=false (independent action)
And user invokes bot tool with parameter action='correct_bot'
When bot tool is invoked with action parameter
Then Bot tool routes to correct_bot action
And Bot tool does NOT use workflow state for routing (parameter overrides)
And Bot tool executes correct_bot without workflow transitions
And Independent actions can be invoked any time via parameter
```

### Scenario: Bot tool defaults to first behavior/action when no state exists

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given bot tool is created
And workflow state does NOT exist
And Bot Config first behavior is 'shape' with first action 'gather_context'
When bot tool is invoked without parameters
Then Bot tool detects no workflow state
And Bot tool defaults to first behavior ('shape')
And Bot tool defaults to first action ('gather_context')
And Bot tool routes to shape.gather_context
And Bot tool creates initial workflow state
```

### Scenario: Bot tool recognizes terminal actions

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given bot tool is created
And workflow state shows: current_action='story_bot.exploration.validate_rules'
And validate_rules action configuration specifies workflow=true, next_action=null (terminal)
When bot tool is invoked
Then Bot tool reads workflow state
And Bot tool routes to exploration.validate_rules
And Bot tool recognizes next_action=null (terminal action)
And Bot tool does NOT inject next action instructions after validate_rules completes
And Bot tool indicates workflow is complete
```

### Scenario: Bot tool handles auto_progress actions

**Steps:**
```gherkin
Given bot tool is created
And workflow state shows: current_action='story_bot.discovery.build_knowledge'
And build_knowledge action configuration specifies auto_progress=true, next_action='render_output'
When bot tool is invoked
Then Bot tool routes to discovery.build_knowledge
And Bot tool recognizes auto_progress=true
And Bot tool automatically transitions to render_output after build_knowledge completes
And Bot tool does NOT wait for human confirmation before transitioning
```

## Generated Artifacts

### Bot Tool
**Generated by:** MCP Server Generator  
**Location:** MCP server configuration  
**Content:**
- ONE bot tool (not separate tools per behavior/action)
- Tool reads workflow state to determine current behavior/action
- Tool routes to correct behavior/action based on state or parameters
- Tool uses action configuration for workflow transitions
- Tool handles workflow actions, independent actions, terminal actions, auto_progress

## Notes

- Generator creates ONE overall bot tool (not separate tools per behavior/action)
- Bot tool is workflow-state-aware: reads workflow state to determine current behavior/action
- Bot tool can route based on workflow state OR explicit action parameter
- Workflow actions (workflow: true) trigger automatic transitions using next_action
- Independent actions (workflow: false) can be invoked via parameter, no workflow transitions
- Terminal actions (next_action=null) indicate workflow completion
- Auto_progress actions transition automatically without human confirmation
- Bot tool is fault-tolerant: handles missing state, malformed configuration gracefully
