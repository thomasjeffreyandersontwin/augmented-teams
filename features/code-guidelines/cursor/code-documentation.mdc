#### Code Documentation Standards

**All code files must maintain hierarchical feature documentation**:
1. **Table of Contents** - Must be at the top of every major file
   - Hierarchical numbered sections (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.)
   - Shows all major features and sub-features at a glance
   - keep this up to date as code is generated, reviewed, etc

2. **Section Headers** - Use consistent formatting:
   - `// 1. MAJOR FEATURE   <Subject Area>` (e.g., ATTACKS)
   - `// 1.1 Sub-Feature  <Verb Noun>` (e.g., Create Attacks)
   - `// 1.1.1 Specific behavior when user action`

3. **Behavior-Oriented Naming** - Describe WHAT happens WHEN:
   - ✅ "Show/hide action buttons using animation when hovering over token"
   - ✅ "Create attacks from powers when clicking 'Convert Powers' button"
   - ❌ "Token hover handler" (too vague)
   - ❌ "Attack creation logic" (too abstract)

4. **Function Placement** - Documentation is also used to grroup code so that functions or methods that aligns to TOC entry at top of file
   - Align code at the LOWEST applicable feature level:
   - If function serves ONE specific behavior → place under that behavior (e.g., 2.1.3)
   - If function serves multiple behaviors in a sub-feature → place under sub-feature (e.g., 2.1)
   - If function serves multiple sub-features → place under major feature (e.g., 2)
   - If function used across ALL features → place in COMMON/SHARED, list the requirements supported
