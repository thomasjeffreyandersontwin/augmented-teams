**When** a behavior is added or updated in a feature’s `cursor/` folder,
**then** sync it to the corresponding location in `.cursor/`.

**Always:**
* Preserve file structure (`rules`, `commands`, `functions`, `mcp`).
* Merge MCP configs (`*-mcp.json`) if they already exist.
* Overwrite only if the source is newer.
* Log synced and merged files.

**Never:**
* Edit `.cursor/` directly — it’s generated.
* Sync behaviors marked as “draft” or “experimental.”
