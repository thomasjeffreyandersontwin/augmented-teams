**When** a behavior is added or updated in a feature's `cursor/` folder,
**then** sync it to the corresponding location in `.cursor/`.

**Always:**
* Preserve file structure (`rules`, `commands`, `functions`, `mcp`).
* Merge MCP configs (`*-mcp.json`) if they already exist.
* Merge `tasks.json` files from `features/*/.vscode/tasks.json` into root `.vscode/tasks.json` (combine tasks from all features, avoid duplicate labels).
* Overwrite only if the source is newer.
* Log synced and merged files.

**Never:**
* Edit `.cursor/` directly — it's generated.
* Sync behaviors marked as "draft" or "experimental."


**Executing Commands:**
* `\behavior-sync` — [what the command is] [when to call it]
