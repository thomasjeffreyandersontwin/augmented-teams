describe a command that has a rule
  that is corrected with context
      it should have access to chat context
      it should have access to content with error
      it should have access to rule principles
    when correction is requested
      it should instruct AI prompt to correct the error based on context
      it should insert all exsitingexamples from rule in instructions
      it should insert all principles from rule in instructions
      it should tell AI to examine context for changes to principle
      it should tell AI to examine context for changes to examples
      it should tell AI to propose new principle if needed
      it should tell AI to propose new example if needed
      it should set corrected flag to true
  that generates correction instructions for AI
      it should include instruction to analyze error pattern in context
      it should include instruction to create new principle capturing pattern
      it should include next available principle number
      it should include instruction to use principle_template
      it should include instruction to analyze why principle was unclear
      it should include instruction to improve principle content
      it should include instruction to preserve principle structure
      it should include instruction to run DO example against content to see if would prevent error
      it should include instruction to test example against all other principles
      it should include instruction to auto fix if example violates other principles
      it should include instructions to consider code heirusutic for new example if it makse sense
      it should incllude instructions to create code-heuristics accoridng to code-agent-rules rules and code heristics section
