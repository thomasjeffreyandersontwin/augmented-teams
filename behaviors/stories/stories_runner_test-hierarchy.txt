Stories System
	Purpose: Enable creation, validation, and management of user stories following agile story writing practices

Story Shaping
	
	Story Shape Command
		
		describe StoryShapeCommand that is generating story map
			it should have prompting questions checked before proceeding
			it should have generate instructions that request epic feature story hierarchy structure creation

			it should have generate instructions that require business language verb noun specific and precise
			it should have generate instructions that request shell elaboration to understand full scope
			it should have generate instructions that request epics features and stories extrapolation for increments
			it should have generate instructions that require fine-grained balanced with testable valuable
			it should have generate instructions that require stories sized appropriately in 3 to 12 day range
			it should have AI instructions with principles returned
				
		describe StoryShapeCommand that is validating story map

			it should have validation instructions with violations returned if found
		
		describe CodeAugmentedStoryShapeCommand that is generating story map
			it should have inner StoryShapeCommand generate method delegated to
			it should have violations scanning skipped during generation
		
		describe CodeAugmentedStoryShapeCommand that is validating story map
			it should have inner StoryShapeCommand validate method delegated to
			it should have content scanned using StoryShapeHeuristic
			it should have violations enhanced with principle info and code snippets
			it should have violations formatted as checklist
			it should have violations appended to validation instructions
		
		describe CodeAugmentedStoryShapeCommand that is checking prompting questions
			it should have prompting questions checked if answered in context
			it should have prompts generated to ask user if questions not answered
			it should have normal flow proceeded with if questions answered
	
	Story Market Increments Command
		
		describe StoryMarketIncrementsCommand that is generating increments
			it should have prompting questions checked before proceeding
			it should have generate instructions that request marketable increments of value identification
			it should have generate instructions that request increments placement around the story map
			it should have generate instructions that request increment prioritization based on business priorities
			it should have generate instructions that request relative sizing at initiative or increment level
			it should have generate instructions that request comparison against previous similar work
			it should have AI instructions with principles returned
		
		describe StoryMarketIncrementsCommand that is validating increments
			it should have marketable increment identification validated
			it should have relative sizing approach checked
			it should have increment prioritization validated
			it should have validation instructions with violations returned if found
		
		describe StoryMarketIncrementsCommand that is executing workflow
			it should have generate then validate workflow orchestrated
			it should have generate called first if not generated
			it should have validate called after generate completes
		
		describe CodeAugmentedStoryMarketIncrementsCommand that is generating increments
			it should have inner StoryMarketIncrementsCommand generate method delegated to
			it should have violations scanning skipped during generation
		
		describe CodeAugmentedStoryMarketIncrementsCommand that is validating increments
			it should have inner StoryMarketIncrementsCommand validate method delegated to
			it should have content scanned using StoryMarketIncrementsHeuristic
			it should have violations enhanced with principle info and code snippets
			it should have violations formatted as checklist
			it should have violations appended to validation instructions
		
		describe CodeAugmentedStoryMarketIncrementsCommand that is checking prompting questions
			it should have prompting questions checked if answered in context
			it should have prompts generated to ask user if questions not answered
			it should have normal flow proceeded with if questions answered

Validation
	Purpose: Ensure story maps and increments follow story writing principles
	
	Story Shape Heuristic
		
		describe StoryShapeHeuristic that is scanning story map content
			it should have epic feature story hierarchy structure checked
			it should have user system focus validated not tasks
			it should have business language usage checked
			it should have scope extrapolation and story sizing validated in 3 to 12 day range
			it should have fine-grained and testable balance checked
			it should have violations list with line numbers and messages returned
	
	Story Market Increments Heuristic
		
		describe StoryMarketIncrementsHeuristic that is scanning increment content
			it should have marketable increment identification validated
			it should have increment prioritization checked
			it should have relative sizing approach validated at initiative or increment level
			it should have violations list with line numbers and messages returned

CLI Entry Point
	Purpose: Provide command-line access to all story operations
	
	describe CLI Entry Point that is parsing command-line arguments
		it should have appropriate command type selected
		it should have action determined as generate validate or execute
		it should have command method executed
	
	describe CLI Entry Point that is handling story-shape command
		it should have StoryShapeCommand instance created
		it should have CodeAugmentedStoryShapeCommand wrapper created
		it should have handle cli method called with action and arguments
		it should have results displayed to user
	
	describe CLI Entry Point that is handling story-market-increments command
		it should have StoryMarketIncrementsCommand instance created
		it should have CodeAugmentedStoryMarketIncrementsCommand wrapper created
		it should have handle cli method called with action and arguments
		it should have results displayed to user
	
	describe CLI Entry Point that is handling unknown command
		it should have error message displayed
		it should have error code exited with
	
	describe CLI Entry Point that is handling no arguments
		it should have usage information displayed
		it should have error code exited with
