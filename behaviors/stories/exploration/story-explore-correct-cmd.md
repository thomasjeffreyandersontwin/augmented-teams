## Common Corrections

### 1. AC in Wrong Location
**Problem**: AC found in story documents
**Fix**: Move all AC to feature document, update story documents to reference feature doc

### 2. Wrong AC Format
**Problem**: AC uses "Given/When/Then" format
**Fix**: Convert to "When/Then" format (save "Given" for specifications)

### 3. Technical Language
**Problem**: AC uses code patterns or technical terms
**Fix**: Rewrite in behavioral language (user/system interactions)

### 4. Missing Domain AC
**Problem**: Feature document missing Domain AC section
**Fix**: Add Domain AC section with domain concepts, constraints, relationships

### 5. Missing Consolidation Decisions
**Problem**: No consolidation rationale documented
**Fix**: Document which ACs were consolidated and why

### 6. Incorrect Feature Document Structure
**Problem**: Notes, consolidation decisions, domain rules, or source material appear ABOVE acceptance criteria
**Fix**: Move all notes, consolidation decisions, domain rules, and source material sections BELOW all acceptance criteria
**Correct Order**: Feature Purpose → Domain AC → Stories (with Behavioral AC) → Notes → Consolidation Decisions → Domain Rules Referenced → Source Material

### 7. Missing Gear Emoji in Feature Document Filename
**Problem**: Feature document filename doesn't start with ⚙️ emoji
**Fix**: Rename file from `[Feature Name] - Feature Overview.md` to `⚙️ [Feature Name] - Feature Overview.md`
**Also Fix**: Update all story file references to use gear emoji filename
