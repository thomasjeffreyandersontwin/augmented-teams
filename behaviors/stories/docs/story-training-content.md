# Story Writing Training Content

## Extracted from PowerPoint: "1) Story Writing Training.pptx"

### Slide 1: Focus Story Maps on User *AND* System Activities
- Epic, Feature, Story hierarchy
- Story sizing examples (15D, 7d, 5d)
- Avoid: Arbitrarily decomposing stories to a functional level, regardless of size
- Avoid: Building the map in absence of the people who can estimate the work
- Encourage: Asking how "big or small are the stories in the map?" promoted to production
- Encourage: Breaking / Grouping stories so that most fall into a 3 – 12 day effort range
- Benefits: Enable frequent feedback by decomposing the work into smaller items
- Benefits: Enable high quality feedback by grouping work into meaningful chunks

### Slide 2: Stories Need to Balance Being Fine-Grained As Well As Testable/Valuable
- Avoid: Generic function, verbs, nouns
- Avoid: Overly technical, IT concepts, unless core to domain being discussed
- Encourage: Focusing the language on the business domain
- Encourage: Validating that a business expert can understand the language of most of the stories
- Benefits: A common artifact that serves a wide variety of stakeholders
- Benefits: Lightweight but precise documentation over a tome of illegible content

### Slide 3: Ground the Map in Business Language That is Specific and Precise
- Agile is all about breaking big projects into smaller units of work that can deliver business value
- Big projects and big releases are hard! Lots of variability and unknowns! Lots of dependencies!
- Efficiency takes a back seat to delivering smaller features to the market sooner
- Avoid: Static functional concepts
- Encourage: Verb /Noun language
- Encourage: Language that emphasize performing an operation on an explicit thing
- Benefits: The map is easy to walk through, i.e. it tells a story
- Benefits: Gaps in flow make it easier to spot where the solution may be incomplete

### Slide 4: Favor Active Behavioral Language Over Functional / Capability Breakup
- Use Story Maps to Outline User and System Behavior *NOT* Tasks
- Focus Story Maps on User *AND* System Activities
- Stories Need to Balance Being Fine-Grained As Well As Testable/Valuable
- Ground the Map in Business Language That is Specific and Precise
- Favor Active Behavioral Language Over Functional / Capability Breakup

### Slide 5: Planning, Scheduling and Forecasting
- Stories are integral part of an agile team's ability to plan, schedule and report on progress
- At the beginning of every sprint teams estimate stories by assigning them a point value (1,2,3,5,8,etc) representing the complexity in a story
- This complexity is relative to other stories in the team's backlog
- Estimating continues until a maximum amount of work that can accomplish in a sprint is reached
- Tracking is accomplished by recording how many points worth of work was done inside a sprint, known as velocity to better plan in the future

### Slide 6: Velocity and Pointing Approach
- The Velocity and pointing approach to planning work is a good way to get teams to start collaborating in a way that increases a shared understanding of the work
- Practices like sprint planning and story points are whole team activities
- They are designed as activities that are done by the everyone on the team
- These practices ensure that the team engage in a way that helps them challenge each other's assumption
- These practices encourage team members to challenge each other's understanding of the work that they need to

### Slide 7: Limitations of Point-Based Estimation
- Most Agile Teams eventually hit a wall when it comes to planning their work using a sprint and story based approach
- Extensive data collected in the field shows that pointing based estimations and tracking of velocity is notoriously inaccurate and predictability rarely increases over time
- In practice it is really hard to predict how much work is initiated and complete inside a small increment of time (eg a sprint)
- The result is teams often end up padding their estimates to increase accuracy, or sacrifice accuracy to attain higher velocity
- This practice is also deliberately team, development, and sprint focused which ignores the bigger picture
- The biggest source of delay and churn are often outside the team, happen outside the sprint, and are not directly due to the development team

### Slide 8: Like Sands in an Hourglass So Goes The Stories In Our Teams Lives
- In reality we can take what works with point + sprint planning, adjust to provide both a simpler and more holistic view
- Small stories let us switch from estimating the details, which is both expensive, inaccurate and myopic, to simply counting them
- We estimate the story count during shaping, and then plan progress by predicting how often stories across our flow of delivery
- This works because, as long as most stories are small, we can treat all stories as being effectively the same size for planning and tracking purpose, using the Law Of Large Numbers

### Slide 9: Planning Is Made Simple By Calculating Throughput and Volume
- A good metaphor for this kind of planning is asking how much time it would take to completely fill a bucket of water?
- To calculate we an answer we simply need to understand how large the bucket of water is, and the rate the water being poured into the bucket, or the throughput
- Estimating and planning is done by estimating the story volume of upcoming initiatives and their increments; then predicting what the throughput of the team is going to be and tracking what the throughput of the team has been over time

### Slide 10: Relative Sizing Upstream
- The Agile practice Of Relative Sizing is best conducted where size actually matters, Upstream and for larger buckets of Scope
- Remember as part of Idea Shaping we want to do just enough story mapping to extrapolate how many epics, feature, and stories make up an increment
- At any point the work can be assessed by comparing and contrasting it to work previously completed
- As long work is similar from a platform and team perspective, than it is relatively easy to relatively size the new initiative against previously completed one
- During Idea Shaping and Discovery we are continually identifying and refining our Marketable Increments
- In either of these stages we can relate size our increments in the initiatives against each other as well as previously delivered increments of value that are similar in platform and team skills
- Relative sizing at the initiative and increment level gives us an accelerated and surprisingly accurate estimate of size

### Slide 11: Story Throughput Approach
- The reality is the biggest value of pointing is ensuring that the team only accepts stories that can be completed quickly, and that stories are small
- Use sprint planning and story refinement (to be covered in later in training) as an opportunity to simply reject stories that are too ambiguous, or split work into smaller stories before accepting them
- By only sizing enough work based on actual throughput they keep enough work to keep the team supplied as well creating predictable performance numbers
- This approach scales across the entire delivery flow as we can see the volume of planned or actual work across all states in our kanban
- Stories throughput is a simple and easy way for agile team's ability to plan, schedule and report on progress

### Slide 12: Story Exploration
- Stories are the core artifact we use to describe how we want our system to behave in response to User activity
- Stories are:
  - a unit of scope and value
  - worked on by the entire team
  - Statements of user and system behavior
  - written so they can be tested
  - delivered in features and increments
  - a place holder for conversations and collaboration
  - can be developed and tested in a matter of days
- INVEST principles: Negotiable, Testable, Valuable, Estimate-able, Small, Independent

### Slide 13: Describing Stories Through Acceptance Criteria
- Acceptance Criteria describe the conditions that the story must meet to be accepted as complete by the Product Owner (who represents the user)
- They are a way to share a clear boundary to the scope of a story, and help to describe to a team the conditions under which a story can be considered done
- Are written in a behavior form or a more domain-oriented form

### Slide 14: Best Practices for Writing a User Story
- Above all, Stories are action oriented, and they describe interactions between users and systems
- Telling a good Story involves discussing how we want the system to behave in response to a user interaction
- It is hard to tell a good story by focusing on the delivery or development tasks required to build a system or on system internals
- Tip: Focus Stories on User Interactions and how the system behaves as observed by the users, document tasks and system internals using other artifacts

### Slide 15: Story Format Discussion
- This format came around in the early days of agile
- In the absence of higher-level context, this format is useful to provide a reason for a system behavior to exist
- The format can give the team insight into the mind of the end user, to hopefully help make better design decisions with the end user goal in mind
- It also makes sure that each card represents a small change in the system's behavior
- Be wary of using the typical preconceived agile story template without understanding its purpose
- TIP: If you find yourself writing a "story" that doesn't represent a small increment of system behavior in response to an end user action STOP and consider if the work is actually a story
- HOWEVER: This format is frequently mis-used and attempted to be applied to work that does not require any of the above outcomes to be successful
- With story maps in place, many teams find the typical template to be redundant and use a simple title to convey meaning
- The main focus of the story should be the acceptance criteria, the story summary is only there to provide context!
- Many agile teams use the: As A <User> I Want To <Perform Action> So That <I Receive Value>

### Slide 16: Story Exploration In A Nutshell
- Goal: Perform enough definition and design so that a small cross functional team collectively understands the what, the how, and the who of delivery for the next sprint (or maybe two)
- Key Activities:
  - The understanding of stories & their solution have been refined for a feature or thin slice
  - A subset of the team have taken ownership of delivering the work, estimated it, and committed to start in the next couple of days
  - Supporting design and definition activities are completed necessary to laying out how the stories will be delivered (e.g. UX, Domain Design, etc.)
- Story Writing Related Activities:
  - Share a common understanding of the next feature/slide starting delivery
  - Define Acceptance Criteria for every story inside the next feature / slice to start
  - Refine / Merge/ Split stories as necessary to ensure they are expressed at a small / similar level of details
  - Remaining Key risks/ unknowns/ assumptions have been explored for upcoming to be delivered Stories
- Other Helpful Agile Artifacts: Planning Game, UX, Architecture Modeling, Spec By Example, Domain Driven Design
- Tip: In Exploration you are going relatively deep on a smallest part of the solution that you believe a team can deliver on quickly together, but keep the focus of story writing on completeness from a user / system behavior
- The goal of Story Exploration is to gain a deep share understanding of the outcomes and work required for the team to execute delivery activities together for a short period of time
