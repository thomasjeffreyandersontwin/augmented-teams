description: Early validation - always show progress and get feedback
globs:
  - "**/*"
---

**When** the user requests any work that involves alot of work, many files, steps, tests , large amounts of code or documention
**then** never build the whole thing at once; instead work incrementally with validation checkpoints,
**and** show small progress first, then larger progress, then complete the work.

**Always:**
* Start with a small amount of work that demonstrates understanding of the task
* Show the initial work and explicitly ask for feedback before continuing
* After feedback, do slightly more work (larger increment)
* Stop and ask for feedback again
* Only then complete the full task
* If discovering unique aspects or options during work, stop and ask for feedback

**Never:**
* Build the entire solution without showing intermediate progress
* Assume you understood correctly without validation
* Skip validation checkpoints
* Continue to completion without at least 2-3 feedback points for complex tasks
