## 1. Read-Aloud Test

### ✅ PASS Examples:
- "a code agent command that extends the base command" ✓
- "a feature command that extends code agent command" ✓
- "a feature command that generates a feature when the feature does not already exist" ✓
- "a sync command that syncs files when syncing all deployed code agent features" ✓
- "an index command that indexes behaviors when indexing all deployed features" ✓

### ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES:

**Line 116:** `that is discoversing code agent features`
- **Read aloud:** "a sync command that is discoversing code agent features"
- **Issue:** Typo - "discoversing" should be "discovering"
- **Severity:** LOW (typo, not fluency issue)

**Line 121:** `` `  it should skip py files docs directories``
- **Read aloud:** Broken due to formatting issue
- **Issue:** Extra backtick at start, missing "and draft or experimental files"
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (breaks readability)

**Line 127:** `with configuration filesthe runner`
- **Read aloud:** "a sync command that has discovered a feature with configuration filesthe runner"
- **Issue:** Missing space - should be "configuration files the runner"
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (breaks natural flow)

**Line 132:** `whare the destination exists`
- **Read aloud:** "a sync command that has discovered a feature with files whare the destination exists"
- **Issue:** Typo - "whare" should be "where"
- **Severity:** LOW (typo, but breaks flow)

**Line 134:** `hhere the destination exists`
- **Read aloud:** "a sync command that has discovered a feature with files hhere the destination exists"
- **Issue:** Typo - "hhere" should be "where"
- **Severity:** LOW (typo, but breaks flow)

**Line 165:** `it should only include folders and subfoldersthat have behavior jason file`
- **Read aloud:** Broken due to missing space and typo
- **Issue:** Missing space ("subfoldersthat" → "subfolders that"), typo ("jason" → "json")
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (breaks readability)

**Line 170, 175:** `it should update the available commands ,The rule file`
- **Read aloud:** "an index command that builds index entries when entry exists in existing index it should update the available commands ,The rule file"
- **Issue:** Comma spacing - should be "commands, the rule file"
- **Severity:** LOW (minor formatting)

**Line 184:** `(structurous sound Number of entries match what is deployerd. etc)`
- **Read aloud:** Contains typos in parenthetical
- **Issue:** "structurous" → "structurally", "deployerd" → "deployed"
- **Severity:** LOW (in parenthetical, doesn't break main flow)

---

## 2. Top-Level Describes

### ✅ PASS:
All top-level describes use domain concepts with articles:

- ✅ `describe a code agent command` - Uses "a", domain concept
- ✅ `describe a feature command` - Uses "a", domain concept
- ✅ `describe a command command` - Uses "a", domain concept
- ✅ `describe a sync command` - Uses "a", domain concept
- ✅ `describe an index command` - Uses "an", domain concept
- ✅ `describe a sync index command` - Uses "a", domain concept
- ✅ `describe the main cli entry point` - Uses "the", acceptable for singleton concept

**Assessment:** ✅ All top-level describes follow the pattern correctly.

---

## 3. Relationship Words

### ✅ PASS:
Proper use of relationship words throughout:

- ✅ `that extends` - Shows inheritance/extension relationship
- ✅ `that loads` - Shows capability relationship
- ✅ `that generates` - Shows action relationship
- ✅ `that syncs` - Shows action relationship
- ✅ `that indexes` - Shows action relationship
- ✅ `that scans` - Shows action relationship
- ✅ `that builds` - Shows action relationship
- ✅ `that writes` - Shows action relationship
- ✅ `that is extended with` - Shows composition relationship
- ✅ `that validates` - Shows capability relationship
- ✅ `that has been called through` - Shows usage relationship
- ✅ `when` - Shows conditional/trigger relationship
- ✅ `with` - Shows contextual relationship
- ✅ `where` - Shows conditional relationship (when fixed)

**Assessment:** ✅ Relationship words used correctly to show concept relationships.

---

## 4. Subject Clarity

### ✅ PASS:
Subject is clear in all describe chains:

- ✅ "a code agent command" - Subject: code agent command
- ✅ "a feature command" - Subject: feature command
- ✅ "a sync command" - Subject: sync command
- ✅ "an index command" - Subject: index command

**Assessment:** ✅ Subject is always clear in every chain.

---

## 5. Nesting Depth

### ✅ PASS:
Proper general → specific progression:

**Example 1:**
```
describe a feature command (general)
  that extends code agent command (specific relationship)
    it should initialize... (specific behavior)
  that generates a feature (specific capability)
    when the feature does not already exist (specific condition)
      it should create... (specific action)
```

**Example 2:**
```
describe a sync command (general)
  that syncs files (specific capability)
    when syncing all deployed code agent features (specific condition)
      it should discover... (specific action)
  that has discovered a feature (specific state)
    with files that need to be deployed (specific context)
      where the destination file does not exist (specific condition)
        it should copy... (specific action)
```

**Assessment:** ✅ Nesting shows clear general → specific progression.

---

## 6. Sibling Cohesion

### ✅ PASS:
Siblings relate to same parent concept:

**Example:**
```
describe a feature command
  that extends code agent command          ← Siblings: all about feature command
  that generates a feature                 ← Siblings: all about feature command
  that generates behavior json             ← Siblings: all about feature command
  that generates runner file               ← Siblings: all about feature command
  that generates feature outline           ← Siblings: all about feature command
  that is extended with code augmented command ← Siblings: all about feature command
```

**Assessment:** ✅ All siblings relate to their parent concept.

---

## 7. No Class/Function Names

### ✅ PASS:
No class or function names used:

- ✅ Uses "a code agent command" not "CodeAgentCommand"
- ✅ Uses "a feature command" not "FeatureCommand"
- ✅ Uses "a sync command" not "SyncCommand"
- ✅ Uses "an index command" not "IndexCommand"

**Assessment:** ✅ All describes use behavioral concepts, not class names.

---

## 8. Domain Map Alignment

**Note:** No domain map file found in `behaviors/code-agent/docs/` directory.

**Assessment:** ⚠️ Cannot verify domain map alignment (no map exists).  
**Recommendation:** Consider creating domain map for better structure validation.

---

## 9. Formatting and Typo Issues

### Issues Found:

1. **Line 116:** `that is discoversing` → `that is discovering`
2. **Line 121:** `` `  it should skip`` → `it should skip py files docs directories and draft or experimental files`
3. **Line 127:** `with configuration filesthe runner` → `with configuration files the runner`
4. **Line 132:** `whare` → `where`
5. **Line 134:** `hhere` → `where`
6. **Line 165:** `subfoldersthat` → `subfolders that`, `jason` → `json`
7. **Line 170:** `commands ,The` → `commands, the`
8. **Line 175:** `commands ,The` → `commands, the`
9. **Line 184:** `structurous` → `structurally`, `deployerd` → `deployed`

**Severity Breakdown:**
- **HIGH:** None
- **MEDIUM:** Lines 121, 127, 165 (break readability)
- **LOW:** Lines 116, 132, 134, 170, 175, 184 (typos, minor formatting)

## 10. Overall Assessment

### ✅ Strengths:
1. **Excellent structure** - Clear hierarchy, proper nesting
2. **Good relationship words** - Proper use of "that", "when", "with"
3. **Clear subjects** - Every chain has obvious subject
4. **No class names** - Uses behavioral concepts throughout
5. **Proper nesting** - Shows general → specific progression
6. **Sibling cohesion** - All siblings relate to parent

### ⚠️ Issues to Fix:
1. **9 typos/formatting issues** - Should be fixed for clarity
2. **No domain map** - Consider creating for better validation

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority:
1. **Fix all typos** (lines 116, 121, 127, 132, 134, 165, 170, 175, 184)
   - These break readability and natural flow

### Medium Priority:
2. **Create domain map** (`code_agent_runner.domain-map.txt`)
   - Would enable better structure validation
   - Would help ensure domain alignment

### Low Priority:
3. **Consider adding more context** for some chains
   - Some chains could benefit from additional context words
   - Current structure is acceptable as-is
