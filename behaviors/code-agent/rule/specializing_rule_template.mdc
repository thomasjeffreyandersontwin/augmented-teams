**When** {context},
**then** follow this {specializing_aspect} workflow.

This rule extends and references `{parent_rule_name}.mdc` — all {parent_rule} principles apply throughout.

**Executing Commands:**
{executing_commands}

## Conventions

Naming conventions, file locations, and structural conventions for the subject matter this rule applies to (NOT conventions about the rule file itself). Include context-specific conventions such as naming patterns, file locations, directory structures, and organizational patterns that developers should follow when applying this rule.

**Important:** 
- This section describes conventions for the CODE/ARTIFACTS that follow this rule, NOT conventions about the rule file itself (rule file conventions belong in documentation, not in the rule).
- **Specializing rules** may include framework-agnostic conventions that extend the base rule, but framework-specific conventions belong in specialized rules.

* Framework-agnostic naming convention example for the subject matter (e.g., use nouns for describe blocks)
* Framework-agnostic structural convention (e.g., nest from broad to specific contexts)
* Additional framework-agnostic conventions as needed for the domain/subject this rule covers

## 1. Principle Name

Principle description explaining what this principle covers and why it matters. This principle extends the base rule principles.

**[DO]:**
* Example of correct practice
* Another example of correct practice

```language
// Example code showing correct implementation
```

**[DON'T]:**
* Example of incorrect practice
* Another example of incorrect practice

```language
// Example code showing incorrect implementation
```

**Note:** After creating examples, verify ALL examples against ALL principles in this rule (including base rule principles). Each DO example must follow all principles, and each DON'T example must only violate the intended principle(s).

## 2. Another Principle

Another principle description.

**[DO]:**
* Example of correct practice

**[DON'T]:**
* Example of incorrect practice

## Templates

Templates used for generating files that follow this rule. Include this section if the rule uses or references specific templates.

* `template-name.md` - Description of when and how to use this template
* `another-template.md` - Another template description

## Commands

Commands that implement or use this rule. List all commands that execute this rule's principles.

* `/feature-command-name` — Brief description of what the command does
* `/feature-another-command` — Another command that uses this rule

**FINAL VERIFICATION STEP:** After completing all principles and examples, verify ALL examples in this rule against ALL principles (including base rule principles):
- Read every DO and DON'T example across all principles
- Check each example against every principle to ensure compliance
- Fix any examples that violate principles (even if the violation is in a different principle section)
- Ensure examples are consistent, accurate, and serve as reliable guidance
