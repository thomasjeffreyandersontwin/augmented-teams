## Conventions

Naming conventions, file locations, and structural conventions for the subject matter this rule applies to (NOT conventions about the rule file itself). Include domain-specific conventions such as naming patterns, file locations, directory structures, and organizational patterns that developers should follow when applying this rule.

**Important:** 
- This section describes conventions for the CODE/ARTIFACTS that follow this rule, NOT conventions about the rule file itself (rule file conventions belong in documentation, not in the rule).
- **Base rules must be framework-agnostic** - do NOT include framework-specific conventions (file naming patterns, framework syntax, etc.). Framework-specific conventions belong in specialized rules only.

* Framework-agnostic naming convention example for the subject matter (e.g., use nouns for describe blocks)
* Framework-agnostic structural convention (e.g., nest from broad to specific contexts)
* Additional framework-agnostic conventions as needed for the domain/subject this rule covers

## 1. Principle Name

Principle description explaining what this principle covers and why it matters.

**[DO]:**
* Example of correct practice (framework-agnostic guidance)
* Another example of correct practice
* Use bullet points to describe practices, not code examples

**[DON'T]:**
* Example of incorrect practice (framework-agnostic guidance)
* Another example of incorrect practice
* Do not include code examples in base rules (code examples belong in specialized rules)

**Note:** After creating examples, verify ALL examples against ALL principles in this rule. Each DO example must follow all principles, and each DON'T example must only violate the intended principle(s).

## 2. Another Principle

Another principle description.

**[DO]:**
* Example of correct practice

**[DON'T]:**
* Example of incorrect practice

## Templates

Templates used for generating files that follow this rule. Include this section if the rule uses or references specific templates.

* `template-name.md` - Description of when and how to use this template
* `another-template.md` - Another template description

## Commands

Commands that implement or use this rule. List all commands that execute this rule's principles.

* `/feature-command-name` — Brief description of what the command does
* `/feature-another-command` — Another command that uses this rule

**FINAL VERIFICATION STEP:** After completing all principles and examples, verify ALL examples in this rule against ALL principles:
- Read every DO and DON'T example across all principles
- Check each example against every principle to ensure compliance
- Fix any examples that violate principles (even if the violation is in a different principle section)
- Ensure examples are consistent, accurate, and serve as reliable guidance
