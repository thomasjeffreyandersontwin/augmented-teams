And they can survive almost anything—radiation, starvation, even decapitation for a while—which is probably why Dr. Green chose them for his experiments, because they're so resilient, and now I'm resilient too, which is good for hero work, but also means I heal really fast, like way faster than normal people, because roaches crawl into my wounds and connect themselves with this weird resin to replace everything that's lost, and the more I regenerate, the more I become this humanoid network of interconnected cockroaches, and it's useful but also kind of freaky, and the way their cells divide is different from humans, they have simpler DNA replication which means fewer mutations, and that's part of why they can survive radiation, and—",
