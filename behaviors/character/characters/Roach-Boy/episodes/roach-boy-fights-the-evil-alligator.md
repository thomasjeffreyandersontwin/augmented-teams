## Episode Content

Roach-Boy uses his most devastating attack on the alligator but misses

I unleash my most devastating attack—the roaches swarm forward in a massive wave, thousands of them converging on the alligator, ready to crawl inside, to overwhelm, to consume. But the alligator moves faster than I expected, its massive tail whipping around, and my swarm hits empty air. The roaches scatter, skittering everywhere, and I'm left standing there, my antennae twitching frantically, sensing the alligator's movement but too late, always too late.

"Missed me! Missed me again! Bro, you're making this too easy, fr fr! Like, roaches can detect air movement changes in 0.0001 seconds, no cap. That's faster than you can even think, fr! But you... you're moving way faster than I thought you would. Like, seriously, how did you get so big? Did you eat everything in that toilet? Because that's actually kind of impressive, in a really gross way. And now you're here, and I'm missing, and this is totally my fault! I should've been faster, I should've anticipated your movement, I should've—"

The alligator lunges, and I'm already moving, my body contorting in ways that shouldn't be possible, joints bending like a roach's. I drop low, roaches scattering around me like a living shield, and its jaws snap shut on empty air where I was standing. I slip between its legs, my body flowing like liquid, then spring up behind it. Roaches are already swarming up its back before it can turn. A couple crawl out from under my sleeves, joining the swarm.

"But hey, at least now I know you're fast! And roaches are pretty good at adapting, fr fr! We've had, like, millions of years of practice! Actually, roaches have been around for 320 million years—they survived the Permian extinction, the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, everything. And you think you can outmaneuver me? That's lowkey cute, fr fr! Also, you're still missing!"
