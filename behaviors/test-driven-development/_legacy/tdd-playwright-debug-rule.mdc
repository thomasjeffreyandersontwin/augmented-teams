## Command: dev-playwright-test [test_pattern]
Runs Playwright tests in debug mode with Chrome MCP integration for browser-based testing.

**Args:**
- `test_pattern` (optional) - Test name pattern to grep. If omitted, runs all tests.

**PREREQUISITES:**
- **REMINDER: Ensure Chrome is open with remote debugging and DevTools (F12) open**
- Chrome must be launched with: `chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222`

**Usage:**
```bash
node command-runners/playwright-debug.mjs [test_pattern]
```

**Examples:**
- `node command-runners/playwright-debug.mjs` - Run all Playwright tests
- `node command-runners/playwright-debug.mjs "hover menu"` - Run tests matching pattern
- `node command-runners/playwright-debug.mjs "better-attacks.test.mjs"` - Run specific test file

**Features:**
- Runs Playwright in headed mode with single worker
- Connects to existing Chrome instance (no new browser launch)
- Test failures pause for inspection
- Integration with Chrome DevTools MCP for debugging

**On Test Failure - Use Chrome MCP Tools:**
- `take_snapshot` - Get current page state with element UIDs
- `list_console_messages` - See browser console errors
- `evaluate_script` - Inspect game objects and variables
- `list_network_requests` - Check API calls
- **DO NOT use `navigate_page`** - it opens new tabs

**Best Practices:**
- Always open Chrome in debug mode before starting tests
- Keep DevTools (F12) open for file overrides to work
- Use Chrome MCP tools for inspection, not custom scripts
- Test connects to existing browser instance for faster iteration

**Integration:**
- Works with `playwright.config.mjs` for test configuration
- Integrates with Chrome DevTools MCP server
- Supports connection to existing browser instance
- Enables rapid browser inspection during test failures
