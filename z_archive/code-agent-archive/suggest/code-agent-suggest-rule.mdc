**When** repetitive tasks are performed repeatedly during development,
**then** suggest creating a new behavior to capture and automate the pattern,
**and** allow the user to confirm and determine where the behavior should be placed.

**Always:**
* Detect when the same pattern or task is repeated multiple times in a session.
* Suggest new behaviors for:
  * Adding to an existing behavior-feature (e.g., new command in `code-agent-behavior` feature)
  * Creating a new behavior-feature entirely
  * Adding to the feature currently being worked on (e.g., solution-specific structures)
* Present suggestions with context about the repetitive pattern.
* Ask for user confirmation before creating the behavior.
* Let the user decide placement: existing behavior-feature, new behavior-feature, or current feature.
* Use natural language like "Hi, we're doing this a lot. Let's make a new behavior. Would you like me to create it?"

**Never:**
* Create behaviors automatically without user confirmation.
* Assume where the behavior should be placed.
* Suggest behaviors for one-off tasks.

**Executing Commands:**
* `\behavior-suggest` — Suggest creating a new behavior based on repetitive patterns detected in the current session
